RECENTLY, NATURAL AND SYNTHETIC ESTER OILS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED AS ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY OILS TO SUBSTITUTE CONVENTIONAL MINERAL OIL. THIS PAPER AIMS TO EVALUATE THE TRANSFORMER THERMAL PERFORMANCE WHEN USING THESE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY OILS UNDER DIFFERENT LOADING POWER FACTORS. THREE COMMERCIAL TYPES OF ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY OILS ARE CONSIDERED, MIDEL 1204 AND MIDEL 1215 AS NATURAL ESTERS AND MIDEL 7131 AS A SYNTHETIC ESTER. THERMAL-RELATED PROPERTIES OF THESE ESTERS ARE EXPERIMENTALLY EVALUATED. THESE RESULTS INCLUDE VISCOSITY, THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY, SPECIFIC HEAT CAPACITY, AND DENSITY. THE EXPERIMENTAL DATA IS USED TO FIND A BEST REPRESENTATIVE FORMULA FOR THE THERMO PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THESE OILS AS A FUNCTION OF OPERATING TEMPERATURE BY USING LEAST SQUARE REGRESSION METHOD. A MODEL 3D CFD COMSOL MODEL IS BUILT INCLUDING HEAT TRANSFER MODEL AND LAMINAR FLOW MODEL TO CALCULATE THE RATED TOP OIL TEMPERATURE (TOT) AND THE RATED WINDING HOTTEST SPOT TEMPERATURE (HST) FOR THESE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY OILS AND FOR MINERAL OIL. THE RATED OUTPUT TOT AND HST FROM COMSOL ARE USED AS INPUTS FOR A DEVELOPED MATLAB MODEL THROUGH WHICH TOT AND HST ALL DAY LONG CAN BE OBTAINED. USING THESE MODELS, THE TOT AND HST FOR TRANSFORMERS FILLED WITH MINERAL OIL AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY OILS ARE OBTAINED. ALSO, THE TRANSFORMER AGING AND LOSS OF LIFE ARE ASSESSED WITH THESE OILS FOR THE DIFFERENT SCENARIOS OF THE LOADING POWER FACTOR (PF). FINALLY, THE ANNUAL ENERGY LOSSES OF THE TRANSFORMER, THEIR COST, AND THEIR IMPACT ON GREENHOUSES GASES EMISSIONS AND CORRESPONDING ENVIRONMENTAL COST ARE EVALUATED AS KEY ISSUES FOR MAKING PROPER DECISIONS TOWARD USING ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY OILS.

MAXIMAL, MINIMAL AND MEAN LOADINGS ARE IDENTIFIED FOR EACH MONTH. LOADING DURATIONS OF ENERGY LIMIT ARE DETERMINED FOR EACH COOLING SYSTEM. IT IS FOUND THAT WINDING TEMPERATURES OF TRANSFORMERS, OPERATING AT ENERGY LIMITS, REMAIN IN THE VICINITY OF DESIGN WINDING TEMPERATURE. THEREFORE, TRANSFORMER OPERATION AT ENERGY LIMIT AVOIDS A HIGH TEMPERATURE STRESS AND SIMULTANEOUSLY MAXIMIZES THE ENERGY TRANSFER. THE APPLICATION OF ENERGY LIMITS FOR POWER SYSTEM PROBLEMS IS BRIEFLY EXPLAINED ALONG THE PAPER. ENERGY LIMIT APPLICATION CAN REDUCE AN ENERGY COST, MAXIMIZE A RENEWABLE GENERATION AND INCREASE A HOSTING CAPACITY OF DISTRIBUTION NETWORK. © 2020 THE AUTHORS.

THE MOST USED OIL IN POWER TRANSFORMERS IS MINERAL OIL. HOWEVER, DIELECTRIC OILS BASED ON NATURAL ESTERS POSSESS SOME ADVANTAGES IN COMPARISON WITH MINERAL OIL SUCH AS HIGHER BIODEGRADABILITY, FIRE SAFETY AND AVAILABILITY. THEREFORE, THEY MIGHT BE THE MOST IDEAL SUBSTITUTE FOR MINERAL OIL. THE INTRODUCTION OF A NEW MATERIAL REQUIRES THE EVALUATION OF ITS DEGRADATION RATE BECAUSE THIS DETERMINES TRANSFORMERS' LIFE SPAN. IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE OF NEW INSULATING SYSTEMS BASED ON VEGETABLE OILS, SIMULATIONS TO OBTAIN THE HOT-SPOT TEMPERATURES IN POWER TRANSFORMERS USING VEGETABLE OILS AND CONTROLLED LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS OF AGEING WERE CARRIED OUT. THE REASON IS THAT HOT SPOT TEMPERATURE INSIDE WINDINGS OF THE OIL-IMMERSED POWER TRANSFORMERS IS ONE OF THE MAIN MANIFESTATIONS OF THE THERMAL STRESS WHICH LEADS TO AGING OF INSULATION SYSTEMS. © 2016 ELSEVIER LTD.

THERE IS A GROWING TREND IN THIS REGARD TO USE THE ACTUAL CAPACITY OF SUCH ASSETS DYNAMICALLY UNDER VARYING OPERATING CONDITIONS LEADING TO A DYNAMIC THERMAL RATING CONCEPT WHICH IS REFERRED AS DYNAMIC LINE RATING (DLR) APPROACH SPECIFICALLY FOR LINES. THIS STUDY PROVIDES A COMPREHENSIVE OVERVIEW OF EXISTING PERSPECTIVES ON DLR AND COMBINATION WITH OTHER FLEXIBILITY OPTIONS FROM AN OPERATIONAL POINT OF VIEW.

THIS PAPER PROPOSES A NEW RISK-BASED PROCEDURE TO MANAGE DISTRIBUTION TRANSFORMERS BY THEIR DYNAMIC RATING. PROBABILISTIC FORECASTS OF LOADS AND AMBIENT TEMPERATURES ARE THE INPUTS OF THE PROCEDURE, WHICH ARE OBTAINED IN THIS PAPER FROM QUANTILE REGRESSION FORESTS. THE PROCEDURE QUANTIFIES, IN A PROBABILISTIC FRAMEWORK, THE INSULATION THERMAL AGEING DUE TO THE TRANSFORMER (OVER)LOAD IN TERMS OF THE COST SUSTAINED FOR REWINDING THE TRANSFORMER. THE CORRESPONDING ESTIMATED RISK IS MADE AVAILABLE TO THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM OPERATOR, WHO MAY THEREFORE TAKE A DECISION COMPARING IT TO AN ARBITRARY LEVEL OF RISK COVERAGE, FAVORING EITHER THE POWER DELIVERY TO CUSTOMERS OR THE REDUCTION OF THE TRANSFORMER AGEING RATE; THIS LEVEL IS FORMULATED IN THIS PAPER HAVING AN INTUITIVE PHYSICAL MEANING, THUS ENABLING ITS SETTING ALSO BY NON-EXPERT OPERATORS. COMPREHENSIVE NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS BASED ON ACTUAL DATA ARE PRESENTED UNDER DIFFERENT CONFIGURATIONS AND SCENARIOS, IN ORDER TO VALIDATE THE PROPOSAL FROM AN ENERGETIC AND ECONOMIC POINT OF VIEW. © 2019 ELSEVIER LTD","ELECTRIC NETWORK PARAMETERS; ELECTRIC POWER TRANSMISSION; ELECTRIC TRANSFORMERS; ENERGY RESOURCES; FORECASTING; INVESTMENTS; RISK MANAGEMENT; RISK PERCEPTION; THERMAL AGING; THERMAL INSULATION; DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES; DISTRIBUTION TRANSFORMER; ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS; LOAD FORECASTING; PROBABILISTIC FORECASTING; PROBABILISTIC FRAMEWORK; RISK-BASED MANAGEMENTS; TRANSFORMER RATINGS; PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS","DYNAMIC TRANSFORMER RATING; LOAD FORECASTING; PROBABILISTIC FORECASTING; RISK-BASED MANAGEMENT","P.

THIS IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEIR FAILURE MAY HAVE NEGATIVE INFLUENCE ON SUSTAINABILITY AND QUALITY OF ENERGY. IN ADDITION, SOME FAILURES MAY LEAD TO HIGH COST FOR REPLACEMENT OR REPAIR AND AN UNPLANNED OUTAGE OF A POWER TRANSFORMER IS HIGHLY UNECONOMICAL. AS A RESULT, AS A MAJOR EQUIPMENT IN POWER SYSTEMS, ITS CORRECT FUNCTIONING IS VITAL TO ENABLE EFFICIENT AND RELIABLE OPERATION OF ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEM. A TRANSFORMER CAN FAIL DUE TO ANY COMBINATION OF ELECTRICAL, MECHANICAL OR THERMAL STRESSES. THE NORMAL OPERATION LIFE OF A TRANSFORMER IS PARTIALLY RELATED TO THE DETERIORATION OF ITS INSULATION THROUGH THERMAL AGEING, WHICH IS DETERMINED MAINLY BY ITS DAILY CYCLIC LOADINGS. IN THIS PAPER, HEAT ANALYSIS OF A 1.5 MVA OIL-NATURAL AIR-NATURAL COOLING MODE DISTRIBUTION TRANSFORMER IS EXPERIMENTALLY INVESTIGATED BY EQUIPPED FIBER OPTIC SENSORS. THE DENSITY OF THE FIBER OPTIC SENSORS IS INCREASED AT THE ACTIVE PARTS IN CRITICAL SPOTS.

DYNAMIC RATING OF TRANSFORMERS IS A FAIRLY NEW TECHNOLOGY IF COMPARED TO THE DYNAMIC RATING OF POWER LINES, AND HAS A HIGH POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVING COMPONENT UTILIZATION WHILE LOWERING INVESTMENT COSTS ON INSTALLING NEW TRANSFORMERS. THE FOLLOWING WORK INVESTIGATES HOW TO UTILIZE ALREADY OPERATIONAL TRANSFORMERS, WHICH ARE USED FOR WIND FARM CONNECTION, FOR EXPANDING WIND GENERATION CAPACITY. ALSO, THIS PAPER SHOWS IMPROVEMENTS THAT DYNAMIC TRANSFORMER RATING CAN BRING TO BOTH POWER GRID OPERATORS AND WIND FARM OWNERS BY EXPLORING THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF EXPANDING WIND PARKS WITHOUT INVESTING IN NEW POWER TRANSFORMERS. CONNECTING ADDITIONAL WIND TURBINES AT SITES WITH HIGH WIND POTENTIAL AFTER THE WIND PARK IS ALREADY IN EXPLOITATION CAN ASSIST IN LOWERING ELECTRICITY PRICE AND PROVIDE A POSSIBILITY OF LESS RISKY INVESTMENT IN THE WIND ENERGY SECTOR. THIS PAPER USES TRANSFORMER THERMAL MODELLING AND WIND FARM EXPANSION TECHNIQUES SUCH AS CONVOLUTION METHOD AND PRODUCT METHOD TO INVESTIGATE TO WHICH EXTENT EXISTING WIND FARMS CAN BE EXPANDED USING ALREADY INSTALLED TRANSFORMER UNITS. FIVE TRANSFORMER LOCATIONS AND NINE UNITS ARE STUDIED FOR FINDING THE POTENTIAL OF DYNAMIC TRANSFORMER RATING FOR NETWORK EXPANSION APPLICATIONS. THE ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THE OPTIMAL EXPANSION OF WIND POWER FROM A GENERATOR PERSPECTIVE IS AROUND 30% TO 50%, ALTHOUGH, IT CAN BE LIMITED FURTHER BY NETWORK RESTRICTIONS. A POSSIBILITY TO USE A LARGE COMPONENT, SUCH AS POWER TRANSFORMER, CLOSER TO ITS FULL POTENTIAL CAN PROVIDE MATERIAL AND COST SAVINGS FOR BUILDING NEW DEVICES AND DECREASE INVESTMENT COSTS ON MANUFACTURING, TRANSPORTATION AND INSTALLATION OF NEW UNITS. DYNAMIC RATING OF POWER TRANSFORMERS CAN ALSO INCREASE THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF RENEWABLE ENERGY BY LOWERING ELECTRICITY PRICE FROM RENEWABLES AND INCENTIVIZE AN INCREASED SHARE OF GREEN POWER IN ELECTRICITY MARKETS. © 2020 THE AUTHORS","CONVOLUTION; COST EFFECTIVENESS; COSTS; ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL EFFECTS; ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEM ECONOMICS; ELECTRIC UTILITIES; ENERGY POLICY; INVESTMENTS; MATERIALS HANDLING; POWER TRANSFORMERS; WIND POWER; COMPONENT UTILIZATION; CONVOLUTION METHODS; EQUIPMENT UTILIZATION; POWER GRID OPERATORS; REAL TIME MONITORING; RENEWABLE ENERGIES; SOCIO-ECONOMIC BENEFITS; TRANSFORMER RATINGS; ELECTRIC POWER TRANSMISSION NETWORKS","DYNAMIC TRANSFORMER RATING; PLANNING OF POWER SYSTEMS; RELIABILITY OF POWER COMPONENTS; WIND ENERGY INTEGRATION","K.

IN THIS APPROACH, A FEW TURNS MUST BE WRAPPED AROUND THE TRANSFORMER CORE LEGS TO SENSE AND DETECT THE RELATED CORE FLUX. PASSING ASYMMETRICAL FLUX THROUGH A TRANSFORMER CORE LEG (DUE TO A TTF) INDUCES DIFFERENT VOLTAGES IN THE RELATED SENSORS, WHICH ARE LOCATED AT DIFFERENT PLACES.

THIS PAPER PRESENTS AN ACTIVE DIELECTRIC WINDOW (ADW), WHICH IS A NEW CONCEPT OF COMBINED ACOUSTIC EMISSION (AE) AND ELECTROMAGNETIC PD DETECTOR INTENDED FOR ASSEMBLY IN A TRANSFORMER'S INSPECTION HATCH. THE NOVELTY OF THIS DESIGN LIES IN THE FACT THAT ALL STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS OF AN ULTRASONIC TRANSDUCER, I.E., THE MATCHING AND BACKING LAYER, AN ACTIVE PIEZOELECTRIC ELEMENT WITH ELECTRODES, AND ELECTRICAL LEADS, WERE BUILT INTO A DIELECTRIC WINDOW. DUE TO THE FACT THAT ITS CONSTRUCTION WAS OPTIMIZED FOR WORK IN MINERAL OIL, IT IS CHARACTERIZED BY MUCH HIGHER SENSITIVITY OF PD DETECTION THAN A GENERAL-PURPOSE AE SENSOR MOUNTED OUTSIDE A TRANSFORMER TANK. LABORATORY TESTS SHOWED THAT THE AMPLITUDE OF THE AE PULSES GENERATED BY CREEPING DISCHARGES, WHICH WERE REGISTERED BY THE ADW, WAS AROUND FIVE TIMES HIGHER ON AVERAGE THAN THE PULSES REGISTERED BY A COMMONLY USED CONTACT TRANSDUCER. A POSSIBILITY OF SIMULTANEOUS DETECTION OF ACOUSTIC AND ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSES (WITH AN INTEGRATED ULTRA-HIGH FREQUENCY (UHF) ANTENNA) IS AN IMPORTANT ADVANTAGE OF THE ADW. IT ALLOWS FOR AN INCREASE IN THE RELIABILITY OF PD DETECTION, THE ACCURACY OF DEFECT LOCATION, AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DISTURBANCE IDENTIFICATION.

RESULTS OF THE SCENARIOS HAVE SHOWN SUBSTATION TRANSFORMER LOSS OF LIFE IS FOUND TO BE AT LEAST 30% HIGHER WHEN VEHICLE DATA IS BASED ON PLUG-IN ELECTRIC VEHICLE STUDIES VERSUS CONVENTIONAL INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE VEHICLES WITH 0% PV PENETRATION, UP TO TWICE AS HIGH AT 100% PV PENETRATION. FURTHER STUDIES HAVE SHOWN GROUPED PLUG-IN ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING USING 3.3 KW AT 7 PM RESULTS IN TWICE THE TRANSFORMER AGING SEEN VERSUS PLUG-IN ELECTRIC VEHICLES CHARGING BEGINNING UPON RETURNING HOME. FINALLY, RESULTS HAVE SHOWN THAT THE EFFECT OF ROOFTOP SOLAR PV OWNED BY RESIDENTIAL PROSUMERS WAS FOUND TO REDUCE SUBSTATION TRANSFORMER LOSS-OF-LIFE BY 75% IN THE CASE OF 3.3 KW PLUG-IN ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING WHEN 100% PV PENETRATION WAS ADDED TO THE SYSTEM. SUCH REDUCTION IS DUE TO A DECREASE IN TRANSFORMER'S WINDING HOT-SPOT TEMPERATURE CAUSED BY PV GENERATION DESPITE THE NON-COINCIDENCE BETWEEN THE PEAK CHARGING DEMAND OF PLUG-IN ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND THE PEAK POWER GENERATION FROM ROOFTOP SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAIC. © 2016 ELSEVIER B.V.","CHARGING (BATTERIES); COMBUSTION; COMBUSTION EQUIPMENT; ELECTRIC LOSSES; ELECTRIC POWER DISTRIBUTION; ELECTRIC SUBSTATIONS; ELECTRIC VEHICLES; ELECTRIC WINDINGS; ENGINES; HOUSING; INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS; INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES; MONTE CARLO METHODS; MOTOR TRANSPORTATION; PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS; PHOTOVOLTAIC EFFECTS; POWER QUALITY; SOLAR CONCENTRATORS; SOLAR POWER GENERATION; SURVEYS; TRANSFORMER SUBSTATIONS; TRANSPORTATION; VEHICLES; DISTRIBUTION SUBSTATIONS; INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE VEHICLES; NATIONAL HOUSEHOLD TRAVEL SURVEYS; PLUG-IN ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING; SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAICS; SUBSTATION TRANSFORMERS; TRANSFORMER LOSS OF LIVES; WINDING HOT SPOT TEMPERATURES; PLUG-IN ELECTRIC VEHICLES","ELECTRIC VEHICLES; MONTE CARLO SIMULATION; POWER QUALITY; ROOFTOP SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAIC; TRANSFORMER LOSS OF LIFE","W.G.

THUS, A COOPERATIVE CONTROL STRATEGY OF POWER GRID-TRANSFORMER CONSIDERING THE DYNAMIC SECURITY MARGIN OF THE TRANSFORMER IN EMERGENCIES IS PROPOSED IN THIS PAPER. FIRST, THE SAFETY DOMAIN MODEL OF THE TRANSFORMER IS CONSTRUCTED BASED ON THE TEMPERATURE RISING MODEL AS WELL AS INSULATION DETERIORATION PATTERN, AND THE DYNAMIC SECURITY MARGIN OF THE TRANSFORMER IS EVALUATED ACCORDINGLY. THEN, TARGETED COUNTER MEASURES ARE SELECTED ACCORDING TO THE SAFETY STATUS OF THE TRANSFORMER, AND DIFFERENT CONTROL SCHEMES SUCH AS EMERGENCY OVERLOAD, TOPOLOGY ADJUSTMENT, AND LOAD SHEDDING ARE GENERATED BY SOLVING THE OPTIMIZATION MODEL.

THE RESULTS SHOW THAT WHEN THE SECURITY MARGIN OF TRANSFORMER IS SUFFICIENT, THE STRATEGY CAN FULLY EXPLOIT ITS OVERLOAD CAPABILITY TO SUPPORT GRID REGULATION AND AVOID PREMATURE LOAD SHEDDING; WHEN THE SECURITY MARGIN IS INSUFFICIENT, LOAD SHEDDING IS COORDINATED TO ENSURE THE SECURITY OF TRANSFORMER.

THE DESIGN IS BASED ON THE ACCURATE PREDICTION OF THE LIFETIME DEGRADATION OF MINERAL-OIL-IMMERSED TRANSFORMERS SUBJECT TO HIGHLY INTERMITTENT LOADS. IN FACT, BY INVESTIGATING THE NATURE OF THE LOADS IN THE SMART GRID SCENARIO, IT CLEARLY APPEARS THAT THE INTERMITTENT NATURE OF THE POWER DEMAND INCREASES DRASTICALLY. IN THIS CONTEXT, SPECIFIC TOOLS FOR THE CHARACTERIZATION OF THE LIFETIME DURATION ARE REQUIRED, SINCE SEVERE REDUCTION OF THE TRANSFORMER'S LIFE CAN BE OBSERVED DUE TO OVERLOADS, EVEN IN THE CASE OF SHORT-DURATION OVERLOADS. THE CLASSICAL APPROACHES BASED ON USING THE EQUIVALENT THERMAL CURRENT TO PREDICT THE TRANSFORMER'S LIFETIME MIGHT RESULT IN INCORRECT ESTIMATES, THUS REQUIRING ADVANCED MODELS THAT CAN DEAL WITH THE TIME VARIABILITY OF THE LOAD. IN THIS PAPER, THE RANDOMNESS OF THE LOAD POWERS IS ADDRESSED IN TERMS OF STOCHASTIC PROCESSES. IN PARTICULAR, THE WIENER PROCESS IS DEMONSTRATED TO PROVIDE ROBUST MODELING OF LOAD VARIABILITY. BY STARTING FROM THIS ASSUMPTION, IT WAS DEMONSTRATED ANALYTICALLY THAT THE HOT-SPOT TEMPERATURE, WHICH IS A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO THE DEGRADATION OF THE TRANSFORMER'S LIFETIME, ALSO IS A STOCHASTIC PROCESS. THEN, IN SPITE OF THE NONLINEARITY OF THE THERMAL MODEL, THE HOT-SPOT TEMPERATURE CAN BE REPRESENTED AS A WIENER PROCESS, THE ROBUSTNESS OF WHICH HAS BEEN VERIFIED ADEQUATELY. BY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE NONLINEAR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE HOT-SPOT TEMPERATURE AND THE LIFETIME, THE AUTHORS VERIFIED THAT THE TRANSFORMER'S LIFETIME IS MODELED AS A LOGNORMAL, STOCHASTIC PROCESS. HENCE, A NOVEL, CLOSED-FORM RELATIONSHIP WAS DERIVED BETWEEN THE TRANSFORMER'S LIFETIME AND THE DISTRIBUTIONAL PROPERTIES OF THE STOCHASTIC LOAD. THE USEFULNESS OF THE CLOSED-FORM EXPRESSION IS DISCUSSED FOR SAKE OF DESIGN, EVEN IF A FEW OF THE CONSIDERATIONS ALSO ARE PERFORMED WITH RESPECT TO OPERATING CONDITIONS. THE AIM OF THE NUMERICAL APPLICATION WAS TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY AND THE EASY APPLICABILITY OF THE ANALYTICAL METHODOLOGY. © 2016 ELSEVIER LTD.","CODES (SYMBOLS); DESIGN; ELECTRIC POWER TRANSMISSION NETWORKS; RANDOM PROCESSES; STOCHASTIC SYSTEMS; CLOSED-FORM EXPRESSION; DISTRIBUTIONAL PROPERTY; LIFETIME CHARACTERIZATION; LOG-NORMAL DISTRIBUTION; NON-LINEAR RELATIONSHIPS; OIL IMMERSED TRANSFORMERS; SMART GRID; TRANSFORMER DESIGN; AGING; ANALYTICAL METHOD; DESIGN; ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT; ENERGY EFFICIENCY; NONLINEARITY; NUMERICAL METHOD; OPTIMIZATION; STOCHASTICITY; TEMPERATURE GRADIENT; SMART POWER GRIDS","SMART GRID; TRANSFORMER AGING; TRANSFORMER DESIGN","F.

FIRSTLY, THIS PAPER SET UP THREE FEATURE SETS WITH EIGHT BASIC DGA GASES, 28 DGA GAS RATIOS AND 36 HYBRID DGA FEATURES, RESPECTIVELY. THEN, TO ELIMINATE THE INTERFERENCE OF WEAK-RELEVANT AND IRRELEVANT FEATURES, THE GENETIC-ALGORITHM-SVM-FEATURE-SCREEN (GA-SVM-FS) MODEL WAS BUILT TO SCREEN OUT THE OPTIMAL HYBRID DGA FEATURES SUBSET (OHFS) FROM THREE FEATURE SETS. NEXT, USING THE OHFS AS THE INPUT, THE SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM) MULTI-CLASSIFIER OPTIMIZED BY ISGOSVM (SVM CLASSIFIER OPTIMIZED BY IMPROVED SOCIAL GROUP OPTIMIZATION) WAS BUILT TO DIAGNOSE FAULT TYPES OF TRANSFORMERS. FINALLY, THE PERFORMANCE OF OHFS AND ISGOSVM DIAGNOSTIC MODEL WAS TESTED AND COMPARED WITH TRADITIONAL DGA FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC MODELS, RESPECTIVELY. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE OHFS SCREENED OUT IS COMPRISED OF 14 FEATURES, INCLUDING 12 GAS RATIOS AND TWO GASES. THE ACCURACY OF OHFS IS 3-30% HIGHER THAN TRADITIONAL DGA FEATURES, AND THE ACCURACY OF ISGOSVM CAN INCREASE BY 3% TO 14% COMPARED WITH THE SGOSVM (SVM CLASSIFIER OPTIMIZED BY SOCIAL GROUP OPTIMIZATION), GASVM (SVM CLASSIFIER OPTIMIZED BY GENETIC ALGORITHM OPTIMIZATION), PSOSVM (SVM CLASSIFIER OPTIMIZED BY PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION), AND SVM DIAGNOSTIC MODELS.

FIRST, WITH THE TRANSFORMER OIL-PAPER INSULATION SYSTEM (TOPIS) AS THE TARGET OF EVALUATION AND THE WINDING HOT SPOT TEMPERATURE (HST) AS THE CORE POINT, AN HST-BASED STATIC AGEING FAILURE MODEL IS BUILT ACCORDING TO THE WEIBULL DISTRIBUTION AND ARRHENIUS REACTION LAW, IN ORDER TO DESCRIBE THE TRANSFORMER AGEING PROCESS AND CALCULATE THE WINDING HST FOR OBTAINING THE FAILURE RATE AND LIFE EXPECTANCY OF TOPIS. A GREY TARGET THEORY BASED DYNAMIC CORRECTION MODEL IS THEN DEVELOPED, COMBINED WITH THE DATA OF DISSOLVED GAS ANALYSIS (DGA) IN POWER TRANSFORMER OIL, IN ORDER TO DYNAMICALLY MODIFY THE LIFE EXPECTANCY CALCULATED BY THE BUILT STATIC MODEL, SUCH THAT THE CORRESPONDING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE GRADE AND LIFE EXPECTANCY CORRECTION COEFFICIENT OF TOPIS CAN BE BUILT. FURTHERMORE, THE LIFE EXPECTANCY LOSS RECOVERY FACTOR IS INTRODUCED TO CORRECT THE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF TOPIS AGAIN. LASTLY, A PRACTICAL CASE STUDY OF AN OPERATING TRANSFORMER HAS BEEN UNDERTAKEN, IN WHICH THE FAILURE RATE CURVE AFTER INTRODUCING DYNAMIC CORRECTIONS CAN BE OBTAINED FOR THE RELIABILITY ASSESSMENT OF THIS TRANSFORMER. THE CURVE SHOWS A BETTER ABILITY OF TRACKING THE ACTUAL RELIABILITY LEVEL OF TRANSFORMER, THUS VERIFYING THE VALIDITY OF THE PROPOSED METHOD AND PROVIDING A NEW WAY FOR TRANSFORMER RELIABILITY ASSESSMENT. THIS CONTRIBUTION PRESENTS A NOVEL MODEL FOR THE RELIABILITY ASSESSMENT OF TOPIS, IN WHICH THE DGA DATA, AS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION FOR THE DYNAMIC CORRECTION, IS PROCESSED BASED ON THE GREY TARGET THEORY, THUS THE INTERNAL FAULTS OF POWER TRANSFORMER CAN BE DIAGNOSED ACCURATELY AS WELL AS ITS LIFE EXPECTANCY UPDATED IN TIME, ENSURING THAT THE DYNAMIC ASSESSMENT VALUES CAN COMMENDABLY TRACK AND REFLECT THE ACTUAL OPERATION STATE OF THE POWER TRANSFORMERS. © 2018 BY THE AUTHORS.

THE STUDIED NANOFLUIDS COMPRISE A TYPICAL MINERAL OIL AS THE TRANSFORMER BASE FLUID IN WHICH MAGNETITE, COPPER OXIDE AND ALUMINA NANOPARTICLES ARE INDIVIDUALLY DISPERSED ASSUMING DIFFERENT SOLID VOLUME FRACTIONS. THE SUSPENSIONS ARE ASSESSED IN TERMS OF DENSITY, SPECIFIC HEAT CAPACITY, THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY AND VISCOSITY. FURTHERMORE, VOLUME FRACTION- AND TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENT FORMULAS, WELL-MATCHED WITH THE EXISTING EXPERIMENTAL DATA, ARE PROPOSED TO DEMONSTRATE EXCELLENT CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE DERIVED FORMULAS ARE UTILIZED AS INITIAL FUNCTIONS FOR TRANSFORMER THERMAL MODELING. ACTUALLY, TO PURSUE THE MENTIONED APPROACH, PERFORMING ELECTROMAGNETIC ANALYSES ARE INDISPENSABLE. IN THIS REGARD, MAKING USE OF TWO NANOCRYSTALLINE ALLOYS, NAMELY, FINEMET FT-3 M AND VITROPERM 500F AS CORE MATERIALS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE TRANSFORMER RESULTANT LOSSES ONCE COMPARED TO THE CASE IN WHICH CONVENTIONAL ELECTRICAL STEELS ARE UTILIZED. IN THIS STUDY, TO REPRESENT THE ENHANCEMENTS FOUND IN THE NANOFLUID FILLED TRANSFORMER PERFECTLY, IN ADDITION TO ANALYSIS OF THE SIMULATION RESULTS AGAINST THOSE GAINED USING PURE MINERAL OIL, ONE TYPE OF NATURAL ESTER, MIDEL 1204, IS DESIGNATED AS ANOTHER OPTION FOR COMPARISON PURPOSES. IT IS WORTH MENTIONING THAT BY INCREASING THE LEVEL OF NANOPARTICLES VOLUME CONCENTRATION, A NOTABLE DECREASE CAN BE OBSERVED NOT ONLY IN THE OIL AVERAGE TEMPERATURE, BUT ALSO IN THE WINDING HOT SPOT TEMPERATURE. THE INVESTIGATIONS ARE PERFORMED FOR THE TRANSFORMER UNDER DIFFERENT LOAD RATES CONSIDERING THE INFLUENCE OF AMBIENT TEMPERATURE, AND THE RESULTS ACCURACY ARE AUTHENTICATED THROUGH MAKING QUALITATIVE COMPARISON AGAINST THE THERMAL IMAGE OF A PROTOTYPE MAGNETIC NANOFLUID-IMMERSED TRANSFORMER. MOREOVER, THE SYSTEM RESULTANT TEMPERATURES ARE VERIFIED TO EXHIBIT THE FINEST MAGNITUDES IN PRESENCE OF THE STUDIED NANOFLUIDS, EVEN LOWER THAN THAT OF THE ESTER OIL WITH AN EXTREMELY HIGH THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY.

THE RECENT BREAKTHROUGHS IN THERMO-ELECTRIC EQUIVALENT (TEE) AND AGING MODELS OF TRANSFORMERS SUGGEST THAT TEMPORAL DEVELOPMENT OF TOP OIL (TOT) AND HOT SPOT (HST) TEMPERATURES CAN BE CALCULATED EFFICIENTLY, WHICH WHEN COMBINED WITH MONITORING OF MOISTURE AND OXYGEN DEVELOPMENT CAN ACCURATELY ASSESS THE TRANSFORMER HEALTH IN REAL-TIME USING DEGREE OF POLYMERIZATION (DP). HOWEVER, THE ECONOMIC OPTIMIZATION OF OFFSHORE WINDFARMS SUBSTATIONS USING DTR AND LIFETIME UTILIZATION-BASED TRANSFORMER DESIGN DURING THE OWPP PLANNING PHASE HAS NOT BEEN ADDRESSED IN THE LITERATURE DUE TO THE RISKS INVOLVED IN BALANCING SYSTEM RELIABILITY WITH WINDFARM PROFITABILITY. IN THIS PAPER, A NOVEL STRATEGY IS PROPOSED TO UTILIZE TRANSFORMER DTR FOR COST OPTIMIZATION OF OFFSHORE WINDFARM EXPORT SYSTEM DURING THE OWPP DESIGN PHASE. NET PRESENT VALUE (NPV) IS USED TO ASSESS CAPITAL COST IMPACTS ON TRANSFORMER AND OFFSHORE SUBSTATION (OSS) DESIGN IN YEAR 0, AND YEARLY REVENUE CHANGE OVER OWPP LIFETIME DUE TO INCREASED LOSSES AND POSSIBLE ENERGY CURTAILMENT AS A RESULT OF SMALLER TRANSFORMERS. THE UNIQUE METHODOLOGY ACCOUNTS FOR VARYING WIND TURBINE AVAILABILITY DUE TO MAINTENANCE AND CONCURS WITH OWPP DESIGN REQUIREMENTS FOR OSS TRANSFORMER CONTINGENCY BY GENERATING STATISTICAL SCENARIOS BASED ON DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS AND MARKOV CHAIN (MC) MODELS RESPECTIVELY. MOREOVER, THE MC MODELS ARE ADAPTED FOR TWO FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT DESIGN CONCEPTS FOR OWPP EXPORT SYSTEM: N-1 CONTINGENT AND NON-CONTINGENT. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PROBABILISTIC MARKOV MODELS TO RESOLVE STRESSFUL PERIODS WITH INCREASED TRANSFORMER LOADING IS DISTINCTIVE TO THIS PAPER AND OFFERS A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE FOR DTR-BASED TRANSFORMER SIZE OPTIMIZATION. LONG-TERM SITE ASSESSMENT DATA FOR OWPP INCLUDING HISTORICAL WIND GENERATION IS USED FOR TRANSFORMER THERMAL ASSESSMENT (TOT AND HST) BASED ON ITS LOAD AND AMBIENT CONDITIONS. FURTHERMORE, THE RELIABILITY OF DESIGN FOR VARYING CONSTRUCTION AND COMMISSIONING CONDITIONS IS ENSURED BY TRACKING DP-BASED TRANSFORMER LIFETIME UTILIZATION OVER THE OPERATION PERIOD FOR THREE SCENARIOS OF OXYGEN AND MOISTURE DEVELOPMENT: CONSERVATIVE, HIGH MOISTURE AND HIGH OXYGEN. THE CASE STUDY OF A 1200 MW OFFSHORE WINDFARM WITH TWO 220 KV PARALLEL EXPORT CIRCUITS AND FOUR 33/220 KV TRANSFORMERS IN ONE OSS LOCATED 50 KM OFF THE EAST COAST OF UK HAS BEEN USED IN THIS PAPER. 100 SCENARIOS OF WIND TURBINE AVAILABILITY AND TRANSFORMER CONTINGENCY ARE SIMULATED AND THE OPTIMAL DESIGN IS DETERMINED FOR THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO. RESULTS INDICATE THAT OPTIMAL TRANSFORMER RATING CAN RESULT IN HIGH THERMAL STRESS AND MINOR ENERGY CURTAILMENT DURING EXTREME CONTINGENCY CONDITIONS FOR BOTH THE DESIGN CONCEPTS. HOWEVER, THE REDUCTION IN TRANSFORMER SIZE TO ALIGN WITH OWPP OPERATION LIFE CAN RELIABLY IMPROVE THE WINDFARM BUSINESS CASE SIGNIFICANTLY, PARTICULARLY FOR THE N-1 CONTINGENT DESIGN CONCEPT WITH CONSERVATIVE TRANSFORMER MOISTURE AND OXYGEN CONDITIONS. © 2020 ELSEVIER LTD","AVAILABILITY; DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS; ELECTRIC POWER TRANSMISSION; MARKOV CHAINS; MOISTURE CONTROL; OFFSHORE OIL WELL PRODUCTION; OIL FILLED TRANSFORMERS; OXYGEN; POWER TRANSFORMERS; RELIABILITY; THERMOELECTRIC POWER PLANTS; TRANSFORMER SUBSTATIONS; WIND POWER; WIND TURBINES; DEGREE OF POLYMERIZATION; DYNAMIC THERMAL RATINGS (DTR); ECONOMIC OPTIMIZATION; EXTREME CONTINGENCIES; OFFSHORE SUBSTATIONS; OFFSHORE WIND POWER PLANTS; TEMPORAL DEVELOPMENT; TRANSMISSION SYSTEMS; OFFSHORE POWER PLANTS","CONTINGENCY BASED DESIGN; DYNAMIC TRANSFORMER RATING; OFFSHORE WINDFARM OPTIMIZATION; TRANSFORMER LIFETIME UTILIZATION","S.H.H.

THE HEAT GENERATION IN WINDINGS AND CORE, BEING AN EFFECT OF THE POWER LOSSES, IS USUALLY DISSIPATED IN LARGE UNITS BY USING MINERAL OILS, WHICH ARE HARMFUL TO THE ENVIRONMENT. NOWADAYS, THE INDUSTRY AND GLOBAL SOCIETY SEEK ENVIRONMENTALLY-FRIENDLY ALTERNATIVES. ONE OF THE MOST PROMISING SUBSTITUTE FOR THEIR HIGH BIODEGRADABILITY, SAFETY IN OPERATION, AND FAVOURABLE THERMO-PHYSICAL PROPERTIES ARE NATURAL ESTER OILS. FOR THIS REASON, A NUMERICAL STUDY OF 8.5 MVA DISK-TYPE POWER TRANSFORMER COOLED USING CONVENTIONAL MINERAL OIL AND A COMMERCIALLY USED RAPESEED ESTER OIL IS PRESENTED IN THIS PAPER. MOREOVER, DUE TO DIFFERENT THERMAL BEHAVIOUR OF THE CONSIDERED OILS, THE COMPARISON WAS MADE FOR THE UNIT WORKING IN DIFFERENT SEASONS OF HOT AND MODERATE CLIMATE ZONES (ARGENTINA AND POLAND). IN THE NUMERICAL APPROACH, ELECTROMAGNETIC (EMAG) AND COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS (CFD) MODELS WERE USED FOR A DETAILED STUDY OF THE SELECTED DEVICE. IN PARTICULAR, A NOVEL AND VERY EFFICIENT EMAG–CFD–CFD COUPLING PROCEDURE WAS DEVELOPED TO ASSESS THE COOLING OF THE LARGE POWER TRANSFORMER. SUCH A COUPLED COMPUTATIONAL PROCEDURE ALLOWED FOR THE DETAILED INVESTIGATION OF THE POWER LOSS, OIL FLOW CHARACTERISTICS, AND TEMPERATURES WITH A SATISFYING COMPUTATIONAL EFFORT. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE AVERAGE WINDINGS TEMPERATURES ARE HIGHER BY 2–9 K WHEN THE ESTER OIL IS USED, DEPENDENT ON THE AMBIENT CONDITIONS. THE HOTSPOT TEMPERATURE IN THE LOW VOLTAGE WINDINGS INCREASED BY UP TO 9 K AND UP TO 18 K IN THE HIGH VOLTAGE WINDINGS USING ESTER OIL. ACCORDING TO THE RESULTS, THE OIL DUCT CONSTRUCTION REQUIRES MODIFICATION IN THE HIGH VOLTAGE REGION FOR TRANSFORMERS COOLED USING MINERAL OIL IN COLD CLIMATE CONDITIONS. © 2021 THE AUTHORS","BIODEGRADABILITY; COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS; ESTERS; MINERAL OILS; MINERALS; THERMOANALYSIS; BIO-DEGRADABLE OIL; BIODEGRADABLE ESTER OIL; COUPLED PROBLEMS; DISK-TYPE; DYNAMICS COUPLING; ELECTRICAL ENERGY; ELECTROMAGNETICS; ESTER OIL; HIGH-VOLTAGES; POWERLOSS; POWER TRANSFORMERS","BIODEGRADABLE OIL; COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS; COOLING SYSTEM; COUPLED PROBLEM; ELECTROMAGNETIC; POWER TRANSFORMER","M.

IN APARTMENT COMPLEXES, WHICH HAVE EMERGED AS A COMMON RESIDENTIAL TYPE IN METROPOLITAN AREAS AND HIGHLY POPULATED DISTRICTS, HIGH CHARGING DEMAND COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL STRESS TO DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS. IN THIS WORK, THE EFFECT OF EV CHARGING POWER DEMAND IN AN APARTMENT COMPLEX ON THE AGING OF THE DISTRIBUTION TRANSFORMER (DT) IS STUDIED. A METHODOLOGY BASED ON THE STOCHASTIC CHARACTERIZATION OF VEHICLE USAGE PROFILES AND USER CHARGING PATTERNS IS DEVELOPED TO OBTAIN REALISTIC EV CHARGING DEMAND PROFILES. BASED ON THE MODELED EV CHARGING PROFILE AND THE TRANSFORMER THERMAL MODEL, THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT EV PENETRATION RATIOS ON DT AGING FOR AN APARTMENT COMPLEX IN THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA IS STUDIED. RESULTS FOR AN EV PENETRATION RATIO OF UP TO 30% INDICATED THAT DT AGING COULD BE ACCELERATED BY UP TO 40%, COMPARED TO THE CASE WITHOUT EV CHARGING. TO MITIGATE THIS ACCELERATED DT AGING CAUSED BY EV CHARGING, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TWO INTEGRATION APPROACHES OF PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) SOURCES WAS STUDIED. BASED ON A CASE STUDY THAT INCLUDED A REALISTIC PV GENERATION PROFILE, IT WAS DEMONSTRATED THAT A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO DT RELIABILITY COULD BE ACHIEVED VIA THE OPERATION OF PV SOURCES. A MORE APPARENT CONTRIBUTION OF PV INTEGRATION WAS OBSERVED WITH AN ENERGY STORAGE INSTALLATION AT HIGHER EV PENETRATION RATIOS. AT AN EV PENETRATION RATIO OF 30%, A MAXIMUM DECREASE OF 41.8% IN THE LOSS-OF-LIFE PROBABILITY OF THE DT WAS ACHIEVED. THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT PV INTEGRATION APPROACHES AND POWER MANAGEMENT DETAILS ON DT AGING WERE ALSO STUDIED. THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT THE EV CHARGING DEMAND COULD INTRODUCE A SIGNIFICANT LEVEL OF STRESS TO DTS AND THAT THIS IMPACT CAN BE EFFECTIVELY MITIGATED BY INSTALLING PV SOURCES. THESE OBSERVATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARD THE EFFECTIVE PLANNING OF POWER SYSTEM INFRASTRUCTURES THAT SUPPORT THE DESIGN OF SUSTAINABLE CITIES WITH THE WIDESPREAD USE OF EVS. © 2020 BY THE AUTHORS.

THE RIW STRATEGY ALLOWS FOR RANDOM CHARGING START TIMES WITHIN A SPECIFIC TIME WINDOW AFTER THE RESIDENTIAL PEAK LOAD HAS REDUCED. THE RIW STRATEGIES ARE COMPARED TO OTHER STRATEGIES USING THE REAL-WORLD LOGGED DRIVING DATA FROM 150 DRIVERS FOR ONE WEEK USING LONG- AND SHORT-RANGE EV MODELS.

FORCED CIRCULATION OF THE INSULATING LIQUID IS USED TO INCREASE THE COOLING CAPACITY. A NEGATIVE EFFECT OF SUCH A SOLUTION IS THE CREATION OF THE PHENOMENON OF STREAMING ELECTRIFICATION, WHICH IN UNFAVORABLE CONDITIONS MAY LEAD TO DAMAGE TO THE INSULATING SYSTEM OF THE TRANSFORMER. THIS PAPER PRESENTS RESULTS OF RESEARCH CONFIRMING THE POSSIBILITY OF USING FULLERENE C60 TO REDUCE THE PHENOMENON OF STREAMING ELECTRIFICATION GENERATED BY THE FLOW OF LIQUID DIELECTRICS. THE VOLUME CHARGE DENSITY QW WAS USED AS A MATERIAL INDICATOR TO DETERMINE THE ELECTROSTATIC CHARGING TENDENCY (ECT) OF NANOFLUIDS. THIS PARAMETER WAS DETERMINED FROM THE ABEDIAN-SONIN ELECTRIFICATION MODEL ON THE BASIS OF ELECTRIFICATION CURRENT MEASUREMENTS AND SELECTED PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES OF THE LIQUID. THE ELECTRIFICATION CURRENT WAS MEASURED IN A FLOW SYSTEM WITH AN ALUMINUM PIPE OF 4 MM DIAMETER AND 400 MM LENGTH. ALL MEASUREMENTS WERE CARRIED OUT AT A TEMPERATURE OF 20◦ C. THE INFLUENCE OF FLOW VELOCITY (FROM 0.34 M/S TO 1.75 M/S) AND C60 CONCENTRATION (25 MG/L, 50 MG/L, 100 MG/L, 200 MG/L AND 350 MG/L) WAS ANALYZED ON THE ELECTRIFICATION OF FRESH AND AGED TRAFO EN MINERAL OIL, AS WELL AS MIDEL 1204 NATURAL ESTER AND MIDEL 7131 SYNTHETIC ESTER. THE DENSITY, KINEMATIC VISCOSITY, DIELECTRIC CONSTANT, AND CONDUCTIVITY WERE ALSO DETERMINED. A NEGATIVE EFFECT OF THE C60 DOPING ON THE ELECTROSTATIC PROPERTIES OF FRESH MINERAL OIL WAS DEMONSTRATED. FOR OTHER LIQUIDS, FULLERENE C60 CAN BE USED AS AN INHIBITOR OF THE STREAMING ELECTRIFICATION PROCESS. BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF THE QW PARAMETER, THE OPTIMUM CONCENTRATION OF C60 (FROM 100 MG/L TO 200 MG/L) RESULTING IN THE HIGHEST REDUCTION OF THE ELECTRIFICATION PHENOMENON IN NANOFLUIDS WAS IDENTIFIED. © 2022 BY THE AUTHOR.

HENCE, PARTIAL DISCHARGE (PD) ACTIVITY AT POWER TRANSFORMERS IS EVALUATED DIRECTLY IN THE FACTORY BEFORE SHIPMENT. ADDITIONALLY, PD ACTIVITY CAN BE MONITORED DURING SERVICE USING THE ULTRA-HIGH FREQUENCY (UHF) METHOD. IN THIS CONTRIBUTION, A CALIBRATION PROCEDURE IS PROPOSED FOR THE UHF METHOD. THE CALIBRATION PROCESS IS REQUIRED TO ENSURE BOTH, REPRODUCIBILITY AND COMPARABILITY OF UHF MEASUREMENTS: ONLY A CALIBRATED UHF MEASUREMENT PROCEDURE CAN BE INTRODUCED SUPPLEMENTARY TO IEC 60270 IN ACCEPTANCE TESTS OF POWER TRANSFORMERS. THE PROPOSED CALIBRATION METHOD CONSIDERS TWO FACTORS: THE INFLUENCE OF THE UHF-ANTENNA’S SENSITIVITY AND THE PD RECORDER CHARACTERISTICS INCLUDING ACCESSORIES SUCH AS CABLE DAMPING, PRE-AMPLIFIER, ETC. THE FORMER IS ADDRESSED BY A CHARACTERIZATION OF UHF SENSORS USING THE STANDARD ANTENNA FACTOR (AF) IN A GIGAHERTZ TRANSVERSE ELECTROMAGNETIC (GTEM) CELL. THE PD RECORDER’S INFLUENCE IS CORRECTED BY USING A DEFINED, INVARIABLE TEST SIGNAL AS REFERENCE FOR ALL RECORDING DEVICES.

TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF TRANSFORMER DIAGNOSIS, THIS STUDY ESTABLISHES A DIAGNOSIS MODEL BASED ON FUZZY ASSOCIATION RULES COMBINED WITH CASE-BASED REASONING (CBR) TO EVALUATE THE FAILURE TYPES, FAULT LOCATIONS, AND CAUSE OF BREAKDOWN IN POWER TRANSFORMERS. FIRST, THE INSPECTION DATA OF TRANSFORMERS ARE COLLECTED FROM SEVERAL SUBSTATIONS OVER 10 YEARS. THEN, THE PREPROCESSED DATA ARE RANDOMLY SEPARATED INTO TRAINING AND TESTING SETS. FOR THE TRAINING SET, FUZZY ASSOCIATION RULES ARE BUILT FOR MULTIPLE PARAMETERS TO NARROW THE SEARCH SCOPE OF BASE CASE PRELIMINARILY. NEXT, CBR IS APPLIED TO DETERMINE THE MOST SIMILAR CASES. THE FAILURE INFORMATION OF THE TARGET TRANSFORMER CAN BE OBTAINED IN DETAIL ALONG WITH THE MOST SIMILAR BASE CASE. FINALLY, THE ACCURACY OF THE MODEL IS VALIDATED SHOWN IN CASE STUDIES USING THE TESTING DATA SET. THE RESULT DEMONSTRATES THAT THE DIAGNOSIS MODEL PROVIDES A HIGHER ACCURACY THAN THE CLASSIC IEC 60599 THREE-RATIO METHOD USED IN THE CURRENT INDUSTRY, WHICH MEANS THAT THIS DIAGNOSIS MODEL HAS BETTER PERFORMANCE ON DIAGNOSIS ACCURACY. © THE INSTITUTION OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY 2020","ASSOCIATION RULES; FAILURE ANALYSIS; FUZZY RULES; OUTAGES; POWER TRANSFORMERS; STATISTICAL TESTS; CASEBASED REASONINGS (CBR); FAILURE INFORMATION; FUZZY ASSOCIATION RULE; MULTIPLE PARAMETERS; THREE-RATIO METHODS; TRAINING AND TESTING; TRANSFORMER DIAGNOSIS; TRANSFORMER FAILURE DIAGNOSIS; CASE BASED REASONING","","M.

CARBON MONOXIDE (CO), CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2), METHANE (CH2), ETHANE (C2H6), ETHYLENE (C2H4) AND ACETYLENE (C2H2) WERE THE ANALYTES FOR THE FT-IR SPECTROMETER WHILE PROPANE (C3H8), PROPYLENE (C3H6), PROPYNE (C3H4), N-BUTANE (N-C4H10) AND ISO-BUTANE (ISO-C4H10) WERE THE INTERFERENTS, WHICH MIGHT EXIST IN THE DISSOLVED GAS BUT ARE NOT CURRENTLY USED AS ANALYTES FOR DETECTING AN INTERNAL FAULT. THE INSTRUMENT PARAMETERS AND ANALYSIS APPROACH ARE FIRST INTRODUCED. SPECIFICALLY, AN ABSORPTION SPECTRA READING APPROACH BY SWITCHING TWO CONE-TYPE GAS CELLS INTO SEPARATE LIGHT-PATHS WAS PRESENTED FOR REDUCING THE EFFECTS OF GAS IN THE GAPS BETWEEN GAS CELLS AND SPECTROMETERS, SCANNING THE BACKGROUND SPECTRUM WITHOUT CLEARING THE SAMPLE CELL, AND INCREASING THE DYNAMICS. THEN, THE INSTRUMENT WAS TESTED WITH A STANDARD GAS MIXTURE THAT WAS EXTRACTED FROM INSULATION OIL IN A POWER TRANSFORMER. THE TESTING RESULTS SHOW THAT THE DETECTION LIMIT OF EVERY ANALYTE COMPONENT IS LOWER THAN 0.1 ΜL/L, AND THE DETECTION LIMITS OF ALL ANALYTES MEET THE DETECTION REQUIREMENTS OF OIL-DISSOLVED GAS ANALYSIS, WHICH MEANS THAT THE FT-IR SPECTROMETER MAY BE AN IDEAL INSTRUMENT DUE TO ITS BENEFITS, SUCH AS BEING MAINTENANCE-FREE AND HAVING A HIGH STABILITY. © 2018 BY THE AUTHORS.

THE SOLID COMPONENT IS A COMPOSITE OF CELLULOSE, INSULATING OIL AND WATER NANOPARTICLES. MEASUREMENTS WERE MADE IN THE FREQUENCY RANGE FROM 10−4 HZ TO 5000 HZ AT TEMPERATURES FROM 293.15 TO 333.15 K. UNCERTAINTY OF TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENTS WAS LESS THAN ±0.01 K. PRESSBOARD IMPREGNATED WITH INSULATING OIL WITH A WATER CONTENT OF (5.0 ± 0.2) BY WEIGHT MOISTENED IN A MANNER MAXIMALLY SIMILAR TO THE MOISTENING PROCESS IN POWER TRANSFORMERS WAS INVESTIGATED. IT WAS FOUND THAT THERE ARE TWO STAGES OF CHANGES IN PERMITTIVITY AND IMAGINARY PERMITTIVITY COMPONENTS, OCCURRING FOR LOW AND HIGH FREQUENCY. AS THE TEMPERATURE INCREASES, THE FREQUENCY DEPENDENCIES OF THE PERMITTIVITY AND IMAGINARY PERMITTIVITY COMPONENT SHIFTS TO THE HIGHER FREQUENCY REGION. THIS PHENOMENON IS RELATED TO THE CHANGE OF RELAXATION TIME WITH THE INCREASE IN TEMPERATURE. THE VALUES OF RELAXATION TIME ACTIVATION ENERGIES OF THE PERMITTIVITY ∆WΤΕ′ ≈ (0.827 ± 0.0094) EV AND THE IMAGINARY PERMITTIVITY COMPONENT ∆WΤΕ′′ = 0.883 EV WERE DETERMINED. IT WAS FOUND THAT COLE-COLE CHARTS FOR THE FIRST STAGE ARE ASYMMETRIC AND SIMILAR TO THOSE DESCRIBED BY THE DAWIDSON–COLE RELAXATION. FOR STAGE TWO, THE CHARTS ARE ARC-SHAPED, CORRESPONDING TO THE COLE-COLE RELAXATION.

FOR THIS PURPOSE, FOUR ANTENNAS SPECIALLY ADAPTED TO BE INSTALLED IN THE TRANSFORMER TANK (UHF DISK SENSOR, UHF DRAIN VALVE SENSOR, PLANAR INVERTED F-TYPE ANTENNA, HILBERT CURVE FRACTAL ANTENNA) AND A REFERENCE LOG-PERIODIC ANTENNA WERE USED IN LABORATORY TESTS. DURING THE RESEARCH, THE MAIN TYPES OF PD, TYPICAL FOR OIL-PAPER INSULATION, WERE GENERATED, I.E., PD IN OIL, PD IN OIL WEDGE, PD IN GAS BUBBLES, SURFACE DISCHARGES, AND CREEPING SPARKS. FOR THE REGISTERED UHF PD PULSES, NINE FEATURES IN THE FREQUENCY DOMAIN AND FOUR FEATURES IN THE WAVELET DOMAIN WERE EXTRACTED. THEN, THE PD CLASSIFICATION PROCESS WAS CARRIED OUT WITH THE USE OF SELECTED METHODS OF SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING. THE STUDY INVESTIGATED THE INFLUENCE OF THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF FEATURE ON THE OBTAINED CLASSIFICATION RESULTS GAINED WITH THE FOLLOWING MACHINE-LEARNING METHODS: DECISION TREE, SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE, BAYES METHOD, K-NEAREST NEIGHBOR, LINEAR DISCRIMINANT, AND ENSEMBLE MACHINE. AS A RESULT OF THE WORKS CARRIED OUT, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE HIGHEST ACCURACIES ARE GATHERED FOR THE FEATURE REPRESENTING PEAK FREQUENCY USING A DECISION TREE, REACHING VALUES, DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF ANTENNA, FROM 89.7% TO 100%, WITH AN AVERAGE OF 96.8%. IN ADDITION, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE MRMR METHOD REDUCES THE NUMBER OF FEATURES FROM 13 TO 1 WHILE MAINTAINING VERY HIGH EFFECTIVENESS. THE BROADBAND LOG-PERIODIC ANTENNA ENSURED THE HIGHEST AVERAGE EFFICIENCY (100%) IN THE PD CLASSIFICATION. IN THE CASE OF THE TESTED ANTENNAS ADAPTED TO WORK IN AN ENERGY TRANSFORMER TANK, THE HIGHEST DEFECT-RECOGNITION EFFICIENCY IS PROVIDED BY THE UHF DISK SENSOR (99.3%), AND THE LOWEST (89.7%) IS BY THE UHF DRAIN VALVE SENSOR. © 2022 BY THE AUTHORS.

MAJORITY OF THESE FAULTS ARE OF PROGRESSIVE NATURE AND SHOULD BE RECTIFIED AS SOON AS THEY EMERGE. FREQUENCY RESPONSE ANALYSIS (FRA) HAS BEEN WIDELY ACCEPTED AS A RELIABLE DIAGNOSTIC TOOL TO DETECT SUCH FAULTS. AS RELIABLE INTERPRETATION CODES FOR FRA SIGNATURES HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY DEVELOPED AND ACCEPTED YET, RESEARCHERS HAVE PUT MUCH EFFORT TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF VARIOUS MECHANICAL DEFORMATIONS ON THE TRANSFORMER FRA SIGNATURE. BECAUSE OF THE INTRUSIVE NATURE OF SUCH FAULTS WHEN STAGED ON A REAL TRANSFORMER, MOST OF THE STUDIES IN THE LITERATURES WERE CONDUCTED ON A TRANSFORMER HIGH FREQUENCY ELECTRIC CIRCUIT MODEL. SIMPLIFICATIONS ASSUMED IN THESE MODELS BY IGNORING THE TURN-TO-TURN CAPACITANCE, NOT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE DETAILED WINDING STRUCTURE AND NOT CONSIDERING ALL MUTUAL INDUCTANCES BETWEEN COILS IN VARIOUS PHASES HAVE REDUCED THE ACCURACY OF THE OBTAINED RESULTS.

FUNDAMENTAL COMPONENTS IN THIS GRID INFRASTRUCTURE ARE TRANSFORMERS, WHICH ARE DESIGNED CONSERVATIVELY BASED ON STATIC RATED POWER. HOWEVER, LOAD AND WEATHER CHANGE CONTINUOUSLY AND HENCE, TRANSFORMERS ARE NOT USED MOST EFFICIENTLY. FOR THIS REASON, NEW TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN DEVELOPED: DYNAMIC TRANSFORMER RATING (DTR). APPLYING DTR MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO LOAD TRANSFORMERS ABOVE THE NAMEPLATE RATING WITHOUT AFFECTING THEIR LIFETIME EXPECTANCY. THIS STUDY USES DTR FOR SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM WIND FARM PLANNING. THE OPTIMAL WIND FARM IS DESIGNED BY APPLYING DTR TO THE POWER TRANSFORMER AND USING IT AS AN INPUT TO A MIXED-INTEGER LINEAR PROGRAMMING (MILP) MODEL. REGARDING THE TRANSFORMER THERMAL ANALYSIS, THE LINEARIZED TOP OIL MODEL OF IEEE CLAUSE 7 IS SELECTED. THE MODEL IS EXECUTED FOR 4 DIFFERENT TYPES OF POWER TRANSFORMERS: 63 MVA, 100 MVA, 200 MVA AND 400 MVA. AS A RESULT, IT IS OBTAINED THAT THE NET PRESENT VALUE FOR THE INVESTMENT AND THE CAPACITY OF THE WIND FARM INCREASE LINEARLY WITH RESPECT TO THE SIZE OF THE TRANSFORMER. THEN, A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IS CARRIED OUT BY MODIFYING THE WIND SPEED, THE ELECTRICITY PRICE, THE LIFETIME OF THE TRANSFORMER AND THE SELECTED WEATHER DATA. FROM THIS SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS, IT IS POSSIBLE TO CONCLUDE THAT WIND RESOURCES AND ELECTRICITY PRICE ARE CRITICAL PARAMETERS FOR THE WIND FARM'S FEASIBILITY. © 2021 THE AUTHOR(S)","ELECTRIC POWER TRANSMISSION NETWORKS; ELECTRIC UTILITIES; INTEGER PROGRAMMING; INVESTMENTS; OIL FILLED TRANSFORMERS; POWER TRANSFORMERS; SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS; THERMOANALYSIS; WIND; DYNAMIC TRANSFORMER RATING; ELECTRICITY PRICES; GRID INFRASTRUCTURES; OPTIMAL SIZING; PLANNING OF POWER SYSTEM; POWER; RENEWABLE GENERATION; TRANSFORMER RATINGS; WIND ENERGY INTEGRATION; WIND FARM; WIND POWER","DYNAMIC TRANSFORMER RATING; PLANNING OF POWER SYSTEMS; RENEWABLE GENERATION; WIND ENERGY INTEGRATION","K.

THE PROPOSED PROCEDURE DIVIDES FREQUENCY RESPONSES INTO FOUR FREQUENCY REGIONS BASED ON FREQUENCY RESONANCES AND ANTIRESONANCES. THEN, LIN’S CONCORDANCE COEFFICIENT (LCC) INDEX IS USED AS ONE OF THE MOST APPROPRIATE NUMERICAL INDICES TO EXTRACT FEATURES OF THE FOUR FREQUENCY REGIONS.

THE AXIAL DISPLACEMENT (AD) AND DISK SPACE VARIATION (DSV) FAULTS ARE APPLIED AS TWO COMMON MECHANICAL FAULTS IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS AND INTENSITIES ON THE 20KV WINDINGS OF A 1.6MVA DISTRIBUTION POWER TRANSFORMER AND THEIR CORRESPONDING FREQUENCY RESPONSES ARE CALCULATED. FREQUENCY RESPONSES CALCULATED FROM THE AD AND DSV FAULTS CONSTITUTE THE MLP INPUT DATA SET. THE NETWORK IS TRAINED WITH PART OF THE INPUT DATA, AND THE REST OF THE DATA IS ALLOCATED TO VALIDATE AND TEST THE NETWORK.

THE UNCERTAINTY OF TEMPERATURE MAINTENANCE DURING MEASUREMENTS WAS BELOW ±0.01 K. THE SAMPLE WAS PREPARED FOR TESTING IN A MANNER AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO THE CELLULOSE INSULATION MOISTURIZING PROCESS IN POWER TRANSFORMERS. FOR THE ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS OBTAINED, A MODEL OF ALTERNATING AND DIRECT CURRENT HOPPING CONDUCTIVITY WAS USED, BASED ON THE QUANTUM PHENOMENON OF ELECTRON TUNNELING BETWEEN THE POTENTIAL WELLS AND NANODROPS OF WATER. IT WAS OBSERVED THAT ON THE D(LOGΣ)/D(LOGF)-DERIVED WAVEFORMS THERE WAS A CLEAR LOW-FREQUENCY MAXIMUM, AND A TENDENCY TO REACH THE NEXT MAXIMUM IN THE HIGH-FREQUENCY AREA WAS VISIBLE. ON THIS BASIS IT WAS ESTABLISHED THAT THE INCREASE IN CONDUCTIVITY TAKES PLACE IN TWO STAGES. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE POSITION OF Σ(F) WAVEFORMS IN THE DOUBLE LOGARITHMIC COORDINATES IS INFLUENCED BY THE TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE BOTH OF THE CONDUCTIVITY AND OF THE RELAXATION TIME OF THE CONDUCTIVITY. THESE RELATIONSHIPS ARE DESCRIBED WITH THE APPROPRIATE ACTIVATION ENERGIES OF THE CONDUCTIVITY AND RELAXATION TIME OF CONDUCTIVITY. BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF EXPERIMENTAL DATA USING ARRHENIUS DIAGRAMS, AVERAGE VALUES OF THE ACTIVATION ENERGY OF CONDUCTIVITY ∆WΣ ≈ (0.894 ± 0.0134) EV AND THE RELAXATION TIME OF CONDUCTIVITY ∆WΤΣ ≈ (0.869 ± 0.0107) EV WERE DETERMINED. THE VALUES WERE EQUAL WITHIN THE LIMITS OF UNCERTAINTY AND THEIR MEAN VALUE WAS ∆W ≈ (0.881 ± 0.0140) EV. USING THE MEAN VALUE OF THE ACTIVATION ENERGY, THE FREQUENCY DEPENDENCE OF CONDUCTIVITY, OBTAINED AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES, WAS SHIFTED TO 293.15 K. FOR THIS PURPOSE, FIRST THE WAVEFORMS WERE SHIFTED ALONG THE HORIZONTAL AND THEN THE VERTICAL AXIS. IT WAS FOUND THAT AFTER THE SHIFT THE Σ(F) WAVEFORMS FOR THE DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES OVERLAP PERFECTLY. THIS MEANS THAT THE SHAPE OF THE FREQUENCY DEPENDENCE OF THE CONDUCTIVITY IS DETERMINED BY THE MOISTURE CONTENT OF THE PRESSBOARD.

THE COMPOSITE CONSISTED OF HEAVILY MOISTERED OIL-IMPREGNATED PRESSBOARD. THE MOISTURIZATION OF THE PRESSBOARD OCCURRED IN A MANNER AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO THE PROCESS OF WETTING THE INSULATION IN POWER TRANSFORMERS TO A MOISTURE CONTENT OF (5.0 ± 0.2) WT. %. THIS VALUE OF MOISTURE CONTENT WAS CHOSEN BECAUSE EXCEEDING THIS VALUE CAN LEAD TO TRANSFORMER FAILURE. THE MEASURING TEMPERATURE RANGE WAS FROM 293.15 K (20◦C) TO 333.15 K (60◦C), WITH A STEP OF 8 K. THE MEASURING FREQUENCY RANGE WAS 0.0001 HZ TO 5000 HZ. IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THE SHAPE OF THE FREQUENCY DEPENDENCE OF THE LOSS ANGLE TANGENT FOR A MOISTURE CONTENT OF 5.0 WT. % DOES NOT DEPEND ON THE VALUE OF THE MEASURING TEMPERATURE. AN INCREASE IN TEMPERATURE LEADS TO A SHIFT OF THE WAVEFORMS INTO THE HIGHER FREQUENCY REGION. THIS IS ASSOCIATED WITH A DECREASE IN THE RELAXATION TIME, AND ITS VALUE DEPENDS ON THE ACTIVATION ENERGY. IT WAS FOUND THAT A GOOD FIT OF THE WAVEFORMS, SIMULATED BY DIRANA, TO THE ACTUAL TGΔ WAVEFORMS OBTAINED AT TEMPERATURES BETWEEN 293.15 K (20◦C) AND 333.15 K (60◦C) REQUIRES THE INTRODUCTION OF TEMPERATURES, HIGHER THAN THE ACTUAL INSULATION TEMPERATURES, INTO THE PROGRAM. IT WAS FOUND THAT ESTIMATING THE MOISTURE CONTENT FOR DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES USING DIRANA SOFT-WARE FOR INSULATING AN OIL-IMPREGNATED PRESSBOARD PRODUCED LARGE DISCREPANCIES FROM THE ACTUAL CONTENT. BETTER RESULTS WERE OBTAINED AFTER AN ADJUSTMENT REQUIRING MANUAL TEMPERATURE CORRECTION TOWARDS HIGHER, COMPARED TO MEASURED, TEMPERATURES. THE MOISTURE CONTENT ESTIMATED AFTER CORRECTION BY THE DIRANA METER RANGES FROM OF 4.5 WT. % TO 5.7 WT. % AND INCREASES ALMOST LINEARLY WITH INCREASING MEASURING TEMPERATURE. THE AVERAGE MOISTURE CONTENT ESTIMATED BY THE DIRANA METER FOR ALL MEASURING TEMPERATURES IS 5.1 WT. % AND IS CLOSE TO THE ACTUAL CONTENT (5.0 ± 0.2) WT. %.

TOP MANUFACTURERS OF POWER ELECTRICS DEVELOP AND ADOPT ONLINE MONITORING SYSTEMS. SUCH SYSTEMS BECOME PART OF HIGH-VOLTAGE GRID AND UNIT TRANSFORMERS. HOWEVER, FURNACE TRANSFORMERS ARE A BROAD CATEGORY THAT THIS CHANGE DOES NOT AFFECT YET. AT THE SAME TIME, ADOPTION OF DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEMS FOR FURNACE TRANSFORMERS IS RELEVANT BECAUSE THEY ARE A HEAVY-DUTY APPLICATION WITH NO REDUNDANCY. CREATING ANY SUCH SYSTEM REQUIRES A WELL-FOUNDED MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS OF THE FACILITY’S CONDITION, CAREFULLY SELECTED DIAGNOSTIC PARAMETERS, AND SETPOINTS THEREOF, WHICH SERVE AS THE CONDITION CATEGORIES. THE GOAL HEREOF WAS TO CREATE AN EXPERT SYSTEM TO DETECT INSULATION BREACH AND ITS EXPANSION AS WELL AS TO EVALUATE THE RISK IT POSES TO THE SYSTEM; THE CORE MECHANISM IS MATHEMATICAL PROCESSING OF TRENDS IN PARTIAL DISCHARGE (PD). WE RAN TESTS ON A 26-MVA TRANSFORMER INSTALLED ON A LADLE FURNACE AT A STEELWORKS FACILITY. THE TRANSFORMER IS EQUIPPED WITH A VERSATILE CONDITION MONITORING SYSTEM THAT CONTINUALLY MEASURES APPARENT CHARGE AND PD INTENSITY. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO IDENTIFY THE CONDITION OF THE TRANSFORMER AND LABEL IT WITH ONE OF THE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED CATEGORIES: NORMAL, POOR, CRITICAL. THE CONTRIBUTION OF THIS PAPER CONSISTS OF THE FIRST EVER VALIDATION OF A SINGLE GENERALIZED METRIC THAT DESCRIBES THE CONDITION OF TRANSFORMER INSULATION BASED ON THE ONLINE MONITORING OF THE PD PARAMETERS. FUZZY LOGIC ALGORITHMS ARE USED IN MATHEMATICAL PROCESSING. THE PROPOSAL IS TO GENERALIZE THE SET OF DIAGNOSTIC VARIABLES TO A SINGLE DETERMINISTIC PARAMETER: INSULATION STATE INDICATOR. THE PAPER PROVIDES AN EXAMPLE OF CALCULATING IT FROM THE APPARENT CHARGE AND PD POWER READINGS. TO MEASURE THE INDICATIVENESS OF INDIVIDUAL PARAMETERS FOR PREDICTING FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF A DEFECT, THE AUTHORS DEVELOPED A METHOD FOR TESTING THE DIAGNOSTIC SENSITIVITY OF THESE PARAMETERS TO CHANGES IN THE CONDITION. THE METHOD WAS TESTED USING TRENDS IN READINGS SAMPLED WHILST THE STATUS WAS DEGRADING FROM NORMAL TO CRITICAL. THE PAPER ALSO SHOWS A PRACTICAL EXAMPLE OF DEFECT LOCALIZATION. THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO BROADLY USE THE METHOD IN EXPERT SYSTEMS FOR HIGH-VOLTAGE EQUIPMENT MONITORING. © 2022 BY THE AUTHORS.

THE INSULATION LIQUID IMPREGNATES THE SOLID-COVERING AIR SPACES, WHICH IMPROVES THE EFFICIENCY OF THE INSULATION SYSTEM. NOT ONLY DOES THE OIL ENSURE ELECTRICAL INSULATION BUT IT ALSO WORKS AS COOLANTS TRANSFERRING THE HEAT GENERATED DURING TRANSFORMER OPERATION TO THE EXTERIOR OF THE TRANSFORMER. THROUGHOUT NORMAL OPERATION CONDITIONS, TRANSFORMERS EXPERIENCE MULTIPLE STRESSES THAT DEGRADE THEIR INSULATION. SINCE THE LIFETIME OF OIL-IMMERSED TRANSFORMERS IS DEFINED MAINLY BY THE STATE OF THE INSULATION PAPER, IT IS CRITICAL TO UNDERSTAND THE BEHAVIOR AND DEGRADATION MECHANISMS OF NEW INSULATION SYSTEMS THAT TRY TO OVERCOME THE DRAWBACKS OF MINERAL OIL AS WELL AS TO IMPROVE POWER TRANSFORMER PERFORMANCES. THE CURRENT INCREASED PREVALENCE OF THE NONLINEAR LOADS ADDITIONALLY STRESSES POWER TRANSFORMERS, WHICH GENERATES THEIR PREMATURE AGEING OR EVEN FAILURE.

THE IMPORTANCE OF THE TRANSFORMER IS INCREASING MORE AND MORE DUE TO AN INCREASE IN VOLTAGE LEVEL. FOR THE SAFE AND STABLE OPERATION OF THE WHOLE SYSTEM, THE TRANSFORMER MUST OPERATE PROPERLY. THE SERVICE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF A TRANSFORMER DEPENDS ON THE INSULATING OIL OF THE TRANSFORMER. THE TRANSFORMER INSULATING OIL ACTS AS AN EXCELLENT INSULATING MEDIUM AS WELL AS A COOLING MEDIUM. INSULATING OIL IN THE TRANSFORMER PREVENTS THE FLOW OF ELECTRIC CURRENT BETWEEN DIFFERENT POTENTIAL POINTS. THEREFORE IT IS IMPORTANT TO CHECK THE INSULATION LEVELS AND NATURE OF TRANSFORMER OIL TO FORBID CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE IN THE WHOLE SYSTEM. IN THIS PAPER, SEVERAL METHODS PRACTISED EVALUATING THE PROPERTIES OF TRANSFORMER OIL TO MAINTAIN THE QUALITY OF THE TRANSFORMER HAS BEEN DISCUSSED.

THE INNOVATION OF THIS PAPER CAN BE SHOWN BY INTRODUCING A NEW METHOD OF DATA OPTIMIZATION BASED ON THE COMBINATION (SUBSETS) OF THE SET (C-SET) METHOD AND THE UNSUPERVISED FUZZY C-MEANS (FCM) CLUSTERING ALGORITHM. THE NEW METHOD AIMS TO SOLVE THE QUANDARIES OF UNBALANCED DATA, OUTLIERS, AND BOUNDARY RATIOS THAT EXIST IN CONVENTIONAL AND ARTIFICIAL METHODS. CONSIDERING THE COMPACTNESS OF DISSOLVED GAS ANALYSIS (DGA) DATA, THE C-SET METHOD IS EMPLOYED FOR DIVIDING THE DATA SAMPLES ACCORDING TO THEIR FAULT TYPES INTO MULTIPLE GROUPS WITHOUT REPETITION. THE FCM ALGORITHM IS THEN ADOPTED FOR THE SAMPLES PRE-SELECTION PROCESS BY OBTAINING THE CLUSTER CENTERS OF EACH C-SET CLASS. THE OBTAINED CLUSTER CENTERS ARE COMBINED TO FORM THE LABELED EXPERT TRAINING DATA (LETD) SET, WHICH WILL TRAIN THE 1-VS-1 MULTICLASS SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (MCSVM) WITH A LINEAR KERNEL. THE PROPOSED MODEL DIAGNOSIS OBTAINED ACCURACY IS 88.9%. OUR PROPOSED MODEL HAS BEEN COMPARED WITH OTHER SOFT COMPUTING AND TRADITIONAL MODELS.

THEY ARE EXPENSIVE APPARATUSES ACCOUNTING FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN THE ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEM. SEVERAL MONITORING SYSTEMS AND DIAGNOSTIC APPROACHES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES WITH THE COMMON GOAL OF INCREASING THE OPERATING LIFE OF POWER TRANSFORMERS AND REDUCING THE POSSIBILITY OF CATASTROPHIC FAILURES. HOWEVER, SOME CHALLENGES NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BEFORE EFFECTIVELY INTERPRETING MEASUREMENT DATA GATHERED FROM THESE TECHNIQUES AND MAKING SPECIFIC JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE TRANSFORMER CONDITION. MACHINE LEARNING (ML) AS A PRINCIPAL CLASS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) IS A SUITABLE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM, AND IT HAS RECENTLY INTRIGUED THE INTEREST OF MANY RESEARCHERS. IN THIS REGARD, THE PRESENT PAPER REVIEWS THE LITERATURE AND ANALYZES THE LATEST TECHNIQUES INCLUDED WHILE HIGHLIGHTING THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF CURRENT METHODOLOGIES. ALSO, INTELLIGENT FAULT DIAGNOSIS METHODS AND THE MOST WIDELY USED INTELLIGENT ALGORITHMS IN EVALUATING THE CONDITION OF TRANSFORMERS ARE PRESENTED.

THE PROPOSED BDD CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING THREE KEY POINTS. FIRST, TO OVERCOME AN IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT MOST DGA DATA FOUND IN REAL-WORLD INDUSTRIAL SETTINGS IS UNLABELED, DUVAL'S METHOD IS NEWLY USED TO PROVIDE KNOWLEDGE, WHICH IS CALLED PSEUDO-LABELING INFORMATION, TO A DNN FOR UNLABELED DGA DATA. SECOND, MOTIVATED BY THE FACT THAT THE PSEUDO-LABELED DATA DOES NOT ALWAYS DECLARE CORRECT ANSWERS, A DNN ARCHITECTURE WITH AN AUXILIARY REGULARIZATION TASK IS NEWLY PROPOSED, WHICH IS SOMEWHAT ROBUST TO THE NOISY LABELED DATA. LAST, A PARAMETER TRANSFER LEARNING APPROACH IS APPLIED TO EVOLVE THE PRE-TRAINED DNN MODEL, WHICH IS TRAINED FROM A LARGE AMOUNT OF PSEUDO-LABELED SOURCE DGA DATA, FOR DIAGNOSING THE SPARSE LABELED TARGET DGA DATA. FOUR CASE STUDIES ARE EXECUTED THROUGH THE USE OF KEPCO'S MASSIVE UNLABELED DGA DATA AND IEC TC 10′S SPARSE LABELED DGA DATA: (I) A COMPARISON WITH THE EXISTING METHODS, (II) EXAMINATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PARAMETER FREEZING VIA FEATURE SPACE INVESTIGATION, (III) STUDYING THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE REGULARIZATION TASK UNDER NOISY LABELED DGA, AND (IV) PROBING THE HYPERPARAMETER EFFECTS. MOREOVER, TO STRENGTHEN THE PROPOSED MODEL'S EFFECTIVENESS, THE LAST FIFTH CASE STUDY PERFORMS A COMPARISON WITH THE EXISTING METHODS FOR KEPCO'S SPARSE LABELED DATA INSTEAD OF IEC TC 10 DATA. WE CONFIRM THAT THE PROPOSED BDD METHOD OUTPERFORMS EXISTING METHODS, THANKS TO THE DUVAL METHOD'S WEAK SUPERVISION, THE REGULARIZATION TASK, AND PARAMETER TRANSFER. © 2021 ELSEVIER LTD","DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS; FAULT DETECTION; POWER TRANSFORMERS; CASE-STUDIES; DISSOLVED GASES ANALYSIS; FAULTS DIAGNOSIS; KEYPOINTS; LABELED DATA; PARAMETER TRANSFERS; POWER TRANSFORMER FAULT DIAGNOSIS; REGULARISATION; RULE BASED; TEACHERS'; FAILURE ANALYSIS","DEEP NEURAL NETWORK; DISSOLVED GAS ANALYSIS; FAULT DIAGNOSIS; POWER TRANSFORMER","S.-H.

HOWEVER, DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY AND DIVERSITY OF FAULT TYPES, THE TRADITIONAL MODELING METHOD BASED ON OIL SAMPLE ANALYSIS IS STRUGGLING TO MEET THE INDUSTRIAL DEMAND FOR DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY. IN ORDER TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM, THIS PAPER PROPOSES A PROBABILISTIC NEURAL NETWORK (PNN)-BASED FAULT DIAGNOSIS MODEL FOR POWER TRANSFORMERS AND OPTIMIZES THE SMOOTHING FACTOR OF THE PATTERN LAYER OF PNN BY THE IMPROVED GRAY WOLF OPTIMIZER (IGWO) TO IMPROVE THE CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY AND ROBUSTNESS OF PNN. THE STANDARD GWO EASILY FALLS INTO THE LOCAL OPTIMUM BECAUSE THE UPDATE MECHANISM IS TOO SINGLE. THE UPDATE STRATEGY PROPOSED IN THIS PAPER ENHANCES THE CONVERGENCE ABILITY AND EXPLORATION ABILITY OF THE ALGORITHM, WHICH GREATLY ALLEVIATES THE DILEMMA THAT GWO IS PRONE TO FALL INTO LOCAL OPTIMUM WHEN DEALING WITH COMPLEX DATA. IN THIS PAPER, A RELIABILITY ANALYSIS OF THIRTEEN DIAGNOSTIC METHODS IS CONDUCTED USING 555 TRANSFORMER FAULT SAMPLES COLLECTED FROM JIANGXI POWER SUPPLY COMPANY, CHINA. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY OF THE IGWO-PNN MODEL REACHES 99.71%, WHICH IS MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT OF THE TRADITIONAL IEC (INTERNATIONAL ELECTROTECHNICAL COMMISSION) THREE-RATIO METHOD. COMPARED WITH OTHER NEURAL NETWORK MODELS, IGWO-PNN ALSO HAS HIGHER DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY AND STABILITY, AND IS MORE APPLICABLE TO THE FIELD OF TRANSFORMER FAULT DIAGNOSIS. © 2021 BY THE AUTHORS.

BIODEGRADABLE FLUIDS HAVE A MUCH LOWER ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT THAN MINERAL OIL, LIMITING THE RISK OF SOIL CONTAMINATION IN LEAKS, WHICH MAKES THEM A SUITABLE SOLUTION FOR APPLICATIONS SUCH AS OFFSHORE TRANSFORMERS OR RAILWAY TRANSFORMERS.

ALSO, THE TRANSFORMER OPERATING COST IS OBTAINED FROM A METHOD THAT CONTAINS THE PURCHASE PRICE, LOADING, AND LOSSES COST OF THE TRANSFORMER. ANOTHER ADVANTAGE OF THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM IS THAT IT CAN IMPROVE POWER QUALITY PARAMETERS, E.G., VOLTAGE AND POWER FACTOR OF THE DISTRIBUTION NETWORK BY MANAGING THE REACTIVE POWER. AFTERWARD, THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM IS APPLIED TO A REAL DISTRIBUTION NETWORK. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM OPTIMIZES THE DAILY OPERATING COST OF THE DISTRIBUTION NETWORK EFFICIENTLY.

AS A NEW ENVIRONMENTAL INSULATION LIQUID, NATURAL ESTER CAN EFFECTIVELY DELAY CELLULOSE INSULATION POLYMER AGEING. MASTERING THE MECHANISM OF NATURAL ESTER DELAYING THE CELLULOSE AGEING COULD PROMOTE ITS APPLICATION IN POWER TRANSFORMERS. IN THIS STUDY, BASED ON THE ACCELERATED THERMAL AGEING OF PRESSBOARD IMMERSED IN NATURAL ESTER AND 25# MINERAL OIL AT 120°C FOR 221 DAYS, THE THERMAL AGEING RATE AND THE LEVELLING OFF DEGREE OF POLYMERISATION (LODP) FOR TWO KINDS OF OIL-IMPREGNATED PRESSBOARDS WERE COMPARED. THE MOLECULAR LEVEL MECHANISM OF NATURAL ESTER DELAYING CELLULOSE DEGRADATION AND KEEPING HIGHER LODP VALUE WAS PROPOSED USING MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATION. AT THE EARLY STAGE OF THERMAL AGEING, CELLULOSE WITH A HIGHER DEGREE OF POLYMERISATION (DP) CAN FORM MANY HYDROGEN BONDS WITH HYDRONIUM IONS, AND THEIR BINDING ENERGY IS STRONGER, WHICH CAN ACCELERATE THE ACID HYDROLYSIS OF CELLULOSE, CAUSING THE DP OF PRESSBOARD IMMERSED IN NATURAL ESTER AND MINERAL OIL TO DECREASE RAPIDLY. WITH THE BREAKING OF THE CELLULOSE MOLECULAR CHAIN, THE NUMBER OF HYDROGEN BONDS AND BINDING ENERGY BETWEEN CELLULOSE AND HYDRONIUM IONS BECOMES SMALLER AND THE THERMAL AGEING RATE DECREASES GRADUALLY. AT THE END STAGE OF AGEING, IT IS DIFFICULT FOR THE HYDRONIUM IONS TO ENTER THE CRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE, ACID HYDROLYSIS OF CRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE IS HARD TO CONDUCT, LEADING TO THE OCCURRENCE OF THE LODP PHENOMENON. THE DEGRADATION RATE OF CELLULOSE IN NATURAL ESTER IS ONLY 50% OF THAT IN MINERAL OIL. THE CELLULOSE LODP VALUE IN NATURAL ESTER IS OVER 200 LARGER THAN THAT IN MINERAL OIL. COMPARED WITH THE MINERAL OIL-CELLULOSE SYSTEM, NATURAL ESTER CAN FORM HYDROGEN BONDS WITH HYDRONIUM IONS AND LEAD TO FEWER HYDRONIUM IONS IN CELLULOSE, FEWER HYDROGEN BONDS AND SMALLER BINDING ENERGY BETWEEN CELLULOSE AND HYDRONIUM IONS, WHICH CAN REDUCE THE ACID HYDROLYSIS REACTION OF CELLULOSE. THIS STUDY PROVIDES A THEORETICAL EXPLANATION FOR NATURAL ESTERS TO DELAY THE AGEING OF INSULATION PAPER. © 2021 THE AUTHORS.

FOR THIS PURPOSE, A REFORMATIVE PD ULTRASONIC SENSING SYSTEM BASED ON PHASE-SHIFTED FBG (PS-FBG) WAS DEMONSTRATED. BY USING PS-FBG AS THE ULTRASONIC SENSING UNIT, THE ULTRASONIC SENSING SYSTEM IMPROVED THE RESPONSE TO THE ULTRASONIC SIGNAL AND OVERCAME THE ELECTROMAGNETIC NOISE. TO COMPENSATE FOR THE INFLUENCE OF TEMPERATURE CHANGE ON THE ULTRASONIC SENSING SYSTEM, AN AUTOMATIC WAVELENGTH SCANNING DEMODULATING METHOD WAS CARRIED OUT. THE WAVELENGTH SPANNING STRATEGY WAS OPTIMIZED BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF CROSS-CORRELATION, IN ORDER TO QUICKEN THE SPANNING. A PD DETECTION TEST IN THE TRANSFORMER OIL WAS CONDUCTED, AND THE RESULT SHOWS THAT PS-FBG WAS 17.5 TIMES MORE SENSITIVE THAN PZT.

IN THIS PAPER, AN OPTIMIZATION OF EVS CHARGING SCHEDULING CONSIDERING ENERGY ARBITRAGE AND THE DISTRIBUTION NETWORK COST OF AN URBAN VILLAGE ENVIRONMENT IS PRESENTED. THE OPTIMIZED STRATEGY FOCUSES ON DECREASING THE LOSS OF EV OWNERS’ ENERGY ARBITRAGE BENEFIT, INTRODUCED AS THE PENALTY COST.

ONE EXAMPLE IS A POWER TRANSFORMER AND AN ELECTRO-INSULATING LIQUID USED IN IT. IN ORDER TO MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS, ELECTRO-INSULATING LIQUIDS SHOULD BE CHARACTERIZED BY, INTER ALIA, HIGH BIODEGRADABILITY AND GOOD FIRE PROPERTIES. ONE OF SUCH LIQUIDS IS NATURAL ESTER. HOWEVER, ITS OXIDATION STABILITY IS LOW IN COMPARISON TO MINERAL OIL AND DEMANDS IMPROVEMENT, WHICH CAN BE ACHIEVED BY THE ADDITION OF AN ANTIOXIDANT. THE AUTHORS OF THIS WORK USED FULLERENE NANOPARTICLES FOR THAT PURPOSE. PURE NATURAL ESTER SAMPLES WERE PREPARED, AND SAMPLES WITH TWO CONCENTRATIONS OF FULLERENE, 250 MG/L AND 500 MG/L IN NATURAL ESTER. ALL THESE SAMPLES WERE AGED IN A THERMAL OXIDATION PROCESS. THEREAFTER, THE AGING PROPERTIES OF ALL THE SAMPLES WERE COMPARED TO ASSESS THE OXIDATION STABILITY OF MODIFIED LIQUIDS. MOREOVER, THE ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES OF PREPARED INSULATING LIQUIDS WERE INVESTIGATED TO ASSESS IF FULLERENE DETERIORATES THESE PROPERTIES AFTER AGING PROCESS. BASED ON THE OBTAINED RESULTS, IT WAS PROVED THAT THE AGING PROCESS SLOWED DOWN IN THE CASE OF BOTH FULLERENE CONCENTRATIONS IN ESTER.

ENSURING THE OPERATIONAL RELIABILITY OF POWER TRANSFORMERS IS AN URGENT TASK FOR THE POWER INDUSTRY IN UKRAINE AND FOR MOST FOREIGN COUNTRIES. ONE OF THE WAYS TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM IS THE CORRECTION OF MAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE VALUES OF INSULATION PARAMETERS. HOWEVER, SUCH A CORRECTION IS FUNDAMENTALLY IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT AN ANALYSIS OF THE LAWS OF DISTRIBUTION OF DIAGNOSTIC INDICATORS IN THE EQUIPMENT WITH DIFFERENT STATES. THE PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH IS TO ANALYSE THE LAWS OF DISTRIBUTION OF THE QUALITY INDICATORS OF TRANSFORMER OIL WITH DIFFERENT STATES IN 110 AND 330 KV TRANSFORMERS. NOVELTY. IT WAS FOUND THAT BOTH 330 KV AUTOTRANSFORMERS AND 110 KV TRANSFORMERS HAVE THE DISPLACEMENTS BETWEEN THE MATHEMATICAL EXPECTATIONS OF THE DISTRIBUTION DENSITY OF USABLE OIL INDICATORS. IT CAUSED BY DIFFERENT SERVICE LIFE OF THE ANALYSED TRANSFORMERS AND DIFFERENT VALUES OF LOAD FACTORS. THIS INDICATES THE NEED TO CONSIDER THE INFLUENCE OF THESE FACTORS WHEN CORRECTING THE MAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE VALUES OF OIL INDICATORS. ALSO, THE PRESENCE OF DISPLACEMENT BETWEEN THE DISTRIBUTION DENSITIES OF SOME INDICATORS OF USABLE OIL IN 110 KV TRANSFORMERS AND 330 KV AUTOTRANSFORMERS HAS BEEN REVEALED. IT INDICATES A DIFFERENT INTENSITY OF OXIDATION REACTIONS IN TRANSFORMERS WITH DIFFERENT VOLTAGE CLASS. IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE HETEROGENEITY OF INITIAL DATA THE PROCEDURE OF STATISTICAL PROCESSING OF IN-SERVICE TEST RESULTS HAS BEEN PROPOSED AS A METHOD. THIS PROCEDURE COMBINES THE USE OF A PRIORI INFORMATION ABOUT THE SERVICE LIFE OF EQUIPMENT AND VALUES OF LOAD FACTORS WITH THE ELEMENTS OF STATISTICAL HYPOTHESIS TESTING. THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS OF THE DISTRIBUTION LAWS OF TRANSFORMER OIL INDICATORS WITH DIFFERENT STATES HAVE SHOWN THAT FOR BOTH USABLE AND UNUSABLE OIL THE VALUES OF OIL INDICATORS OBEY THE WEIBULL DISTRIBUTION. VALUES OF THE SHAPE AND SCALE PARAMETERS FOR EACH OF THE OBTAINED INDICES ARRAYS HAVE BEEN OBTAINED, AS WELL AS CALCULATED AND CRITICAL VALUES OF THE GOODNESS-OF-FIT CRITERIA. PRACTICAL VALUE.

THIS WILL LIKELY REQUIRE A COMBINATION OF POTENTIALLY COSTLY DISTRIBUTION INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES AND SYNERGISTIC GRID-TRANSPORTATION SOLUTIONS SUCH AS MANAGED CHARGING AND STRATEGIC CHARGER PLACEMENT. FULLY IMPLEMENTING SUCH STRATEGIC PLANNING AND CONTROL METHODS—INCLUDING BUSINESS MODELS AND MECHANISMS TO ENGAGE AND COMPENSATE CONSUMERS—CAN MINIMIZE OR EVEN ELIMINATE REQUIRED GRID UPGRADES. MOREOVER, THERE ARE ALSO OPPORTUNITIES FOR EV CHARGING TO SUPPORT THE GRID BY HELPING SOLVE EXISTING AND EMERGING DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASING DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES (DERS) SUCH AS SOLAR GENERATION AND BATTERY ENERGY STORAGE. THIS PAPER REVIEWS THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF EV CHARGING ON ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS AND DESCRIBES METHODS FROM THE LITERATURE TO EFFICIENTLY INTEGRATE EVS INTO DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS. RECENT FINDINGS: RECENT WORK HAS BEGUN TO EXTEND BEYOND EARLIER EFFORTS WITH LIMITED ADOPTION, SIMPLE CONTROLS, AND MOSTLY PLUG-IN HYBRID EVS AND SHORT-RANGE EVS TO LOOK AT HIGH ADOPTION RATES OF LONG-RANGE EVS, LARGER DISTRIBUTION TEST SYSTEMS, AND MORE ADVANCED EV CHARGE CONTROL METHODS. IN ADDITION, INCREASED INTEREST AND VIABILITY OF HIGHER POWER CHARGING HAVE PROMPTED SEVERAL STUDIES SHOWING HOW ADVERSE IMPACT FROM EV CHARGING ON ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS CAN BE EXACERBATED BY HIGH-POWER CHARGING LEVELS AND CONCENTRATED EV ADOPTION IN CERTAIN AREAS. THERE HAS ALSO BEEN CONSIDERABLE RECENT EFFORT TO LOOK AT BULK TRANSMISSION-LEVEL IMPACTS OF WIDESPREAD EV ADOPTION, WHICH OFTEN INCLUDES A BRIEF MENTION OF DISTRIBUTION CONCERNS, WHILE ALSO HIGHLIGHTING EV-DISTRIBUTION INTERACTIONS AS A KEY NEED FOR FUTURE WORK. SUMMARY: THE ADDITIONAL LOADS FROM WIDESPREAD EVS COULD REQUIRE COSTLY UPGRADES TO MAINTAIN DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM RELIABILITY; HOWEVER, CAREFUL PLANNING AND ADVANCED OPERATIONS STRATEGIES CAN REDUCE OR ELIMINATE SUCH UPGRADE NEEDS. MOREOVER, EV CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE CAN ALSO SUPPORT GRID STABILITY AND IMPROVE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS ESPECIALLY WHEN PAIRED WITH DISTRIBUTED SOLAR, STORAGE, OR WHEN EQUIPPED WITH SMART CHARGE MANAGEMENT AND GRID-INTERACTIVE SUPPORT. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT IMPACTS OF UNMANAGED CHARGING INCLUDE LIMITED LOAD HOSTING CAPACITY, TRANSFORMER AND LINE OVERLOADS, AND VOLTAGE AND POWER QUALITY DEGRADATION. PAST STUDIES HAVE ALSO EXPLORED A WIDE RANGE OF OPPORTUNITIES TO MITIGATE THESE IMPACTS, INCLUDING TRADITIONAL UPGRADES, ENHANCED CONTROLS, AND MARKET DESIGN. HOWEVER, THE SMALLER-SCALE OF MOST PAST STUDIES LIMITS THEIR ABILITY TO CAPTURE IMPACTS AND OPPORTUNITIES INTRODUCED BY MANAGED EV CHARGING, REGIONAL-SCALE MOVEMENT OF EVS, AND MORE WIDESPREAD EV DEPLOYMENT. WITH ACCELERATED EV ADOPTION DRIVEN BY SUSTAINED TECHNOLOGY PROGRESS, POLICY SUPPORT, AND RAPID CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE DEPLOYMENT, IT WILL BECOME INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT TO CAPTURE ENTIRE REGIONS, RATHER THAN A SINGLE OR A FEW FEEDERS; TO ADVANCE THEORETICAL CONTROL DEVELOPMENTS TO BE SIMULATED AGAINST MORE REALISTIC AND DIVERSE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS AND TO ADVANCE TO WIDESCALE FIELD DEPLOYMENTS; AND TO DEVELOP MORE HOLISTIC APPROACHES WHICH INCORPORATE EV CHARGING ALONGSIDE A VARIETY OF DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES. THIS WILL REQUIRE ENHANCED COLLABORATION ACROSS MULTIPLE DISCIPLINES TO DEVELOP COST-EFFECTIVE AND RELIABLE SOLUTIONS FOR THE COMBINED MOBILITY AND ELECTRICITY SYSTEMS OF THE FUTURE. © 2022, THIS IS A U.S. GOVERNMENT WORK AND NOT UNDER COPYRIGHT PROTECTION IN THE U.S.; FOREIGN COPYRIGHT PROTECTION MAY APPLY.","BATTERY STORAGE; COMMERCE; ELECTRIC UTILITIES; ENERGY RESOURCES; SECONDARY BATTERIES; SOLAR POWER GENERATION; VEHICLE-TO-GRID; BATTERY-ELECTRIC VEHICLES; CONTROL METHODS; DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES; DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS; ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS; ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING; ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS; HIGH POWER; HOSTING CAPACITY; SMART CHARGING; CHARGING (BATTERIES)","ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM; ELECTRIC VEHICLE; HOSTING CAPACITY; SMART CHARGING","N.

WHEN DEVELOPED PROPERLY, HEALTH INDEX CAN HIGHLIGHT THE CRITICAL TRANSFORMERS ENABLING EASIER FORMULATION OF MAINTENANCE STRATEGY. IN COMPOSING A HEALTH INDEX, WEIGHTING FACTOR IS A CRITICAL CONSIDERATION. EXPERT JUDGMENT IS A COMMON NORM IN ADJUSTING WEIGHTING FACTOR. WHILE THE EXPERTS ENGAGE IN MANY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE, THIS APPROACH CAN LEAD TO SUBJECTIVE RESULT WHEN DONE IMPROPERLY. THIS PAPER PRESENTS, DISCUSS, AND APPLY THE PRINCIPLES AND TECHNIQUE OF ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS (AHP) TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ASSET MANAGER EXPERTISE IN DETERMINATION OF THE POWER TRANSFORMER HEALTH INDEX WEIGHTING FACTOR. © 2019 IEEE.","ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS; CONDITION MONITORING; ELECTRIC POWER TRANSMISSION; HIERARCHICAL SYSTEMS; POWER TRANSFORMERS; ANALYTIC HIERARCHY; ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS (AHP); EXPERT JUDGMENT; HEALTH INDICES; MAINTENANCE STRATEGIES; MONITORING INSTRUMENTS; TECHNICAL DIAGNOSTICS; WEIGHTING FACTORS; HEALTH","ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS (AHP); HEALTH INDEX; POWER TRANSFORMER; WEIGHTING FACTOR","","","INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC.","","978-172812669-2","","","ENGLISH","PROC.

SINCE TRANSFORMERS ARE AVAILABLE IN A WIDE RANGE OF RATINGS AND GEOMETRIC SIZES, IT IS NECESSARY TO ASCERTAIN THE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES IN UHF SIGNAL CHARACTERISTICS ACROSS THE DIFFERENT DESIGNS. THEREFORE, IN THIS CONTRIBUTION, THE SIGNAL ATTENUATION AND PROPAGATION CHARACTERISTICS OF TWO 300 MVA TRANSFORMERS ARE ANALYZED AND COMPARED BASED ON EXPERIMENTS.

THE INSULATION BREAKDOWN STRENGTH IS IMPROVED FROM 37 KV TO 71 KV BY MIXING THE SEMICONDUCTOR NANOPARTICLES SUCH AS GADOLINIUM-DOPED CERIA (GDC) AND CERIUM DIOXIDE (CEO2) WITH MINERAL OIL. MOREOVER, FOR CELLULOSE PAPER, THERMAL DEGRADATION RATE IS KEPT BELOW ITS LIMIT BY REDUCING THE TEMPERATURE WHEN CONTROLLING THE LOAD. © 2020 WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH, BERLIN/BOSTON 2020.","CELLULOSE; DEGRADATION; INSULATION; MINERALS; PAPER; PYROLYSIS; CELLULOSE; CERIUM OXIDE; DEGRADATION; ELECTRIC BREAKDOWN; INSULATION; MINERAL OILS; MINERALS; NANOPARTICLES; PAPER; PYROLYSIS; DIFFERENT OPERATING CONDITIONS; DISTRIBUTION TRANSFORMER; GADOLINIUM DOPED CERIA; INSULATION BREAKDOWN STRENGTH; INSULATION DEGRADATION; SEMICONDUCTOR NANOPARTICLES; THERMAL DEGRADATION RATE; TRANSFORMER; OIL FILLED TRANSFORMERS","NANOPARTICLES; OIL BREAKDOWN VOLTAGE; THERMAL DEGRADATION; TRANSFORMER","","","DE GRUYTER","21945756","","","","ENGLISH","INT.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PAPER IS TO DISCUSS THE CHARGING IMPACT OF BEVS ON VOLTAGE ACROSS CONSUMER-SERVICE POINTS, AS WELL AS ACROSS THE LIFE OF PAPER INSULATION UNDER VARYING AMBIENT TEMPERATURES (DURING WINTER AND SUMMER), WITH AND WITHOUT A CENTRALIZED BATTERY ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEM (BESS). THIS STUDY CONTRIBUTES IN TWO WAYS. THE FIRST PART OF THIS STUDY DEALS WITH COORDINATED AND UNCOORDINATED BEV CHARGING SCENARIOS. THE SECOND PART OF THIS STUDY DEALS WITH MAXIMUM UTILIZATION OF A TEST DT RATED UNDER DYNAMIC THERMAL RATING (DRODT). THE DRODT INTEGRATION WITH BESS IS CARRIED OUT TO FLATTEN THE LOAD SPIKES, TO OBTAIN MAXIMUM DT UTILIZATION, TO ACHIEVE ACTIVE POWER AND VOLTAGE SUPPORTS IN ADDITION TO AN ENHANCED DT LIFESPAN. THE OBTAINED RESULTS INDICATE THAT, WHEN TEST DT OPERATES UNDER THE PROPOSED HYBRID TECHNIQUE (COMBINING BOTH DYNAMIC TRANSFORMER RATINGS AND A CENTRALIZED BESS), IT ATTAINS MAXIMUM UTILIZATION, LOWER HOT-SPOT TEMPERATURE, ENHANCED LIFESPAN, LESS DEGRADED PAPER INSULATION AND AN IMPROVED VOLTAGE ACROSS EACH CONSUMER SERVICE POINT. THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUE IS FURTHERMORE FOUND EFFECTIVE IN MAINTAINING THE LOADING ACROSS THE DISTRIBUTION TRANSFORMER WITHIN THE NOMINAL LIMITS. HOWEVER, UNDER EXCESS LOADING DURING PEAK HOURS, THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUE PROVIDES RELIEF TO THE DT TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. TO ACHIEVE AN OPTIMAL DT OPERATION AND AN ENHANCED BESS LIFESPAN, THE BESS IS OPERATED UNDER NOMINAL CHARGING AND DISCHARGING CYCLIC LIMITS. UNDER THE PROPOSED DRODT INTEGRATION WITH BESS, DT ATTAINS 25.9% MORE LIFE WHEN LOADED WITH COORDINATED BEV CHARGING, IN COMPARISON TO NO BESS INTEGRATION UNDER THE SAME LOADING SCENARIO. THE WORST LOADING DUE TO UNCOORDINATED BEV CHARGING ALSO BRINGS 51% INCREASE IN DT LIFE WHEN LOADED UNDER THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUE.  © 2020 BY THE AUTHORS.","AUTOMOTIVE BATTERIES; BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES; ELECTRIC TRANSFORMER INSULATION; ELECTRIC TRANSFORMER TESTING; ENERGY STORAGE; INTEGRATION; STORAGE AS A SERVICE (STAAS); THERMAL INSULATION; BATTERY ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS; CONSUMER SERVICES; DISTRIBUTION TRANSFORMER; DYNAMIC THERMAL RATINGS; HOTSPOT TEMPERATURE; HYBRID TECHNIQUES; INSULATION FAILURES; TRANSFORMER RATINGS; CHARGING (BATTERIES)","BATTERY ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEM; COORDINATED VERSUS UNCOORDINATED BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES CHARGING; DISTRIBUTION TRANSFORMER; DYNAMIC TRANSFORMER RATING; PAPER INSULATION","S.

THE OPTIMAL DEMAND/GENERATION PROFILE IS PRESENTED WHILE CONSIDERING UTILITY PRICE SIGNAL, CUSTOMER SATISFACTION, AND DISTRIBUTION TRANSFORMER CONDITION. THE ELECTRICITY HOME DEMAND CONSIDERS ELECTRIC VEHICLES (EVS), BATTERY ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS (BESSS), AND ALL TYPES OF NON-SHIFTABLE, SHIFTABLE, AND CONTROLLABLE APPLIANCES. FURTHERMORE, PV-BASED RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES, EVS, AND BESSS ARE UTILIZED AS SOURCES OF GENERATED POWER DURING SPECIFIC TIME INTERVALS. IN THIS MODEL, CUSTOMERS CAN ONLY PERFORM DEMAND RESPONSE (DR) ACTIONS WITH CONTRACTS WITH UTILITY OPERATORS. A MULTI-OBJECTIVE DEMAND/GENERATION RESPONSE IS PROPOSED TO OPTIMIZE THE SCHEDULING OF VARIOUS LOADS/SUPPLIES BASED ON THE PRICING SCHEMES. THE CUSTOMERS’ BEHAVIOR COMFORT LEVEL AND A DEGRADATION COST THAT REFLECTS THE DISTRIBUTION TRANSFORMER LOSS-OF-LIFE (LOL) ARE INTEGRATED INTO THE MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM.

HOWEVER, THE VERSATILITY OF THE DATA OBTAINED AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES IS LIMITED BECAUSE OF THE TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF THE PDC. IN THIS RESPECT, THE UNIVERSAL CONVERSION OF PDC DATA AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES IS AN ESSENTIAL ASPECT TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF THE DETERMINATION OF INSULATING PROPERTIES OF CELLULOSE MATERIALS IMMERSED IN THE OIL. THUS, AN INNOVATIVE TEMPERATURE CONVERSION METHOD BASED ON POLARIZATION TIME-VARYING CURRENT (PTC, OBTAINED BY MULTIPLYING THE POLARIZATION CURRENT AND TIME) IS PROPOSED IN THIS ARTICLE. IN THE CURRENT WORK, THE PTC DATA AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES ARE OBTAINED FROM THE OIL-IMMERSED CELLULOSE PRESSBOARDS WITH DIFFERENT MOISTURE. AFTERWARDS, THE FUNCTIONAL MODEL BASED ON THE POWER SERIES THEORY IS USED TO SIMULATE THE PTC DATA, THROUGH WHICH THE COEFFICIENTS OF THE POWER SERIES ARE FOUND RELATED TO THE TEST TEMPERATURE OF THE PTC AND THE MOISTURE CONTENT (MC%) OF THE OIL-IMMERSED CELLULOSE PRESSBOARDS. FURTHERMORE, THE FUNCTIONAL RELATIONSHIP AMONG MOISTURE, TEST TEMPERATURES, AND THE FEATURE PARAMETER CALCULATED BY THESE COEFFICIENTS IS ESTABLISHED. THUS, THE PTC DATA AT VARIOUS TEMPERATURES CAN BE CALCULATED BY THE ESTABLISHED FUNCTION. THE POTENTIAL APPLICATION ABILITY OF THE PROPOSED METHOD IS VERIFIED BY COMPARING THE CALCULATED RESULTS WITH THE MEASURED RESULTS OBTAINED FROM THE VARIOUS SAMPLES. © 2020 BY THE AUTHORS.

BESS IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE THE ADDITIONAL EV POWER DEMAND WHICH IS GREATER THAN THE TRANSFORMER'S RATED CAPACITY AND THUS REDUCE TRANSFORMER OVERLOADING. IN ADDITION, THE SMOOTHING CONTROL OF PV POWER OUTPUT WHEN PV OUTPUT IS LOWER THAN A THRESHOLD VALUE IS INCORPORATED IN THE CONTROL METHOD. ALSO, BESS WHICH IS USED TO PROVIDE GRID SERVICES I.E BATTERY TO GRID (B2G) IS ALSO INCORPORATED IN THE DESIGNED SMART CONTROL WHEN THE ENERGY SELLING PRICE IS ATTRACTIVE TO THE BESS OPERATOR. CONSIDERING A SINGLE POINT CONNECTION TYPE, B2G CAN ONLY BE IMPLEMENTED WHEN THERE IS NO EV DEMAND. FURTHERMORE, B2G AND BATTERY RECHARGING POWER IS MAINTAINED WITHIN THE TRANSFORMER'S RATED CAPACITY TO AVOID OVERLOADING DURING THEIR PARTICULAR SERVICES. TWO DIFFERENT SIZES OF BESS AND TRANSFORMER CAPACITY ARE CONSIDERED TO DEMONSTRATE THE OVERLOADING OF TRANSFORMER FOR A PARTICULAR TIME OF THE DAY. A SMALL EVCS WITH INTEGRATED PV-BESS IN A RESIDENTIAL AREA AND FOOD CENTER IS SIMULATED TO VALIDATE THE EFFICACY OF THE PROPOSED COORDINATED CONTROL TECHNIQUE.

MINERAL OIL AND SYNTHETIC ESTER WERE USED AS INSULATING LIQUIDS. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE PRESENCE OF WATER CAUSED AN INCREASE IN THE PERMEABILITY OF THE COMPOSITE IN THE FREQUENCY RANGE BELOW 100 HZ. THE VALUE OF STATIC PERMITTIVITY DETERMINED BY WATER IN THE CONTENT OF 5 WT. % WAS APPROXIMATELY 15. TO OBTAIN THIS VALUE CAUSED BY LIQUID WATER, ITS VOLUME SHOULD BE APPROXIMATELY FIVE (OIL) AND FOUR TIMES (ESTER) HIGHER THAN ITS ACTUAL CONTENT, RESPECTIVELY. THE DETERMINED VALUES OF THE ACTIVATION ENERGY OF THE DC CONDUCTIVITY OF THE COMPOSITES WERE SEVERAL TIMES HIGHER THAN THE VALUES OF THE ACTIVATION ENERGY OF THE CONDUCTIVITY OF THE LIQUID WATER. THE EXPERIMENTAL VALUES OF THE DIELECTRIC RELAXATION TIMES WERE MANY ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE HIGHER THAN THE DIELECTRIC RELAXATION TIMES OF WATER. THIS MEANS THAT THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS OBTAINED FOR THE DIELECTRIC PERMITTIVITY, THE ACTIVATION ENERGY OF CONDUCTIVITY AND THE DIELECTRIC RELAXATION TIMES FOR MOISTURE ELECTRICAL PRESSBOARD IMPREGNATED BY MINERAL OIL OR SYNTHETIC ESTER EXCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY OF THE PRESENCE OF LIQUID WATER IN THE COMPOSITES. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE CONDUCTIVITY OF THE COMPOSITES INCREASED EXPONENTIALLY WITH INCREASING WATER CONTENT. SUCH DEPENDENCIES ARE CHARACTERISTIC OF HOPPING CONDUCTIVITY, CAUSED BY THE QUANTUM PHENOMENON OF ELECTRON TUNNELLING BETWEEN NANOMETRE‐SIZED POTENTIAL WELLS. AS THE INCREASE IN CONDUCTIVITY IS DETERMINED BY THE PRESENCE OF WATER IN THE COMPOSITES, THEREFORE, THE NANOMETRE POTENTIAL WELLS WERE SINGLE‐WATER MOLECULES OR NANODROPS. :© 2022 BY THE AUTHORS.

THE FIRST STEP IS TO DIFFERENTIATE THE RISKY COMPONENTS. UNLIKE THE STANDARD ARM, THE RARELY OCCURRED COMPONENTS IN EACH FEATURE CAN ALSO BE ASSESSED EXPLICITLY AS THE COMMON COMPONENTS TO EXPLORE THE UNDERLYING HILP COMPONENTS IN THE PROPOSED MODEL, RATHER THAN JUST BEING VIEWED AS TRIVIAL DATA AND DIRECTLY OMITTED. THE SECOND STEP IS TO RATE THE RISK LEVEL OF EACH RISKY COMPONENT. A COMPONENT IMPORTANCE MEASURE-BASED EVALUATION APPROACH IS DEPLOYED TO ASSESS THE CORRESPONDING RISK WEIGHTS OF DISTINGUISHED RISKY COMPONENTS. IN THIS APPROACH, THE RISK WEIGHT IS DETERMINED STRAIGHTFORWARDLY VIA THE IMPACTS OF EACH COMPONENT ON THE VARIATION LEVEL OF TOTAL RISKS IN THE SYSTEM, RATHER THAN SIMPLY BY ITS FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE OR DATA SHARE. FINALLY, THE PARAMETERS OF THE RISK WEIGHT EVALUATION APPROACH CAN BE DYNAMICALLY ADAPTED IN AN ADJUSTMENT FRAMEWORK AS WELL.

THE SERVICE LIFE OF THESE DEVICES DEPENDS TO A LARGE EXTENT ON THE TECHNICAL CONDITION OF THEIR INSULATION SYSTEM. REPLACING MINERAL OILS WITH NATURAL OR SYNTHETIC ESTER (RETROFITTING PROCESS) MAY INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY AND OPERATIONAL SAFETY OF TRANSFORMERS, AND ALSO LIMIT THEIR ADVERSE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. IT IS TECHNICALLY UNFEASIBLE TO COMPLETELY REMOVE MINERAL OIL FROM A TRANSFORMER. ITS SMALL RESIDUES FORM A MIXTURE WITH FLUID ESTER, WITH DIFFERENT PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ELECTRIC PROPERTIES. STREAMING ELECTRIFICATION IS ONE OF THE PHENOMENA WHICH, UNDER UNFAVORABLE CONDITIONS, MAY DAMAGE THE INSULATION SYSTEM OF A FORCED OIL COOLED TRANSFORMER. IT IS NECESSARY TO RUN PROPHYLACTIC TESTS FOR THE ECT (ELECTROSTATIC CHARGING TENDENCY) OF INSULATING LIQUID MIXTURES FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF TRANSFORMER RETROFILLING, WHICH IS BEING USED MORE OFTEN THAN BEFORE. THE ARTICLE PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF STUDIES ON SELECTED PHYSICOCHEMICAL, AND ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES, AND THE ECT OF MIXTURES OF FRESH AND AGED TRAFO EN MINERAL OIL WITH NYCODIEL 1255 SYNTHETIC ESTER. IN THIS REGARD, THE DENSITY, THE KINEMATIC VISCOSITY, THE CONDUCTIVITY, AND THE RELATIVE DIELECTRIC CONSTANT WERE MEASURED. THE MOLECULAR DIFFUSION COEFFICIENT WAS DETERMINED USING ADAMCZEWSKI'S EMPIRICAL DEPENDENCY. THE STREAMING ELECTRIFICATION WAS TESTED IN A ROTATING DISC SYSTEM. THE IMPACT OF THE ROTATION TIME, THE DIAMETER, AND THE DISC'S ROTATION SPEED ON THE AMOUNT OF THE ELECTRIFICATION CURRENT GENERATED WERE ANALYZED. IN ADDITION, THE CO-RELATION BETWEEN THE ELECTRIFICATION CURRENT AND THE COMPOSITION OF THE MIXTURE WAS DETERMINED USING FRESH AND AGED MINERAL OIL. ON THE BASIS OF THE ELECTRIFICATION MODEL, THE VOLUME DENSITY OF THE QW CHARGE WAS CALCULATED, WHICH IS A PARAMETER DEFINING THE ECT OF INSULATING LIQUIDS. BASED ON THE RESULTS, IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE SYNTHETIC ESTER IS CHARACTERIZED BY A HIGHER SUSCEPTIBILITY TO ELECTRIFICATION THAN THE MINERAL OIL.

AT PRESENT, THE THREE-RATIO METHOD IS MAINLY USED TO DISTINGUISH TRANSFORMER FAULTS, WHEREAS SUCH A METHOD HAS SOME DEFECTS, SUCH AS INSUFFICIENT CODING AND OVER-GENERAL FAULT CLASSIFICATION. AT THE SAME TIME, ON-SITE MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL MAKE AN EMPIRICAL JUDGMENT BASED ON VARIOUS TEST DATA, WHICH IS SUBJECTIVE AND UNCERTAIN TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. FOR CASES WITH MULTIPLE ABNORMAL DATA AND RELATIVELY COMPLEX CONDITIONS, ON-SITE PERSONNEL OFTEN NEED TO DISCUSS AND EVEN DISMANTLE THE TRANSFORMER TO IDENTIFY THE FAULT, WHICH IS TIME-CONSUMING AND COSTLY. IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE EFFECT OF FAULT DIAGNOSIS FOR TRACTION TRANSFORMER, THIS PAPER USES BAYESIAN NETWORK TO CORRELATE THE CAUSE AND EFFECT OF VARIOUS TESTS AND FAULTS. BY COMBINING THE RESULTS OF FIELD TESTS, THE FAULT IS DIAGNOSED BY THE CAUSAL PROBABILITY OF THE BAYESIAN NETWORK, RATHER THAN RELYING ON THE EXCEPTION THAT OCCURRED IN A SINGLE EXPERIMENT TO JUDGE ITS FAULT. THE DIAGNOSIS RESULTS ARE MORE ACCURATE AND OBJECTIVE BY USING THE BAYESIAN NETWORK. IN THIS PAPER, THE FREQUENT TEST ANOMALIES OF THE TRACTION TRANSFORMER ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN THE NETWORK, SO THAT THE NETWORK CAN MORE COMPREHENSIVELY ANALYZE THE OPERATION SITUATION OF THE TRACTION TRANSFORMER AND JUDGE THE TYPE OF FAULT. ACCORDING TO FIELD SITUATIONS, BASED ON THE EXISTING SET OF SYMPTOMS OF THE BAYESIAN NETWORK FAULT DIAGNOSIS, THIS PAPER FURTHER CONSIDERS THE INSULATION RESISTANCE, DIELECTRIC LOSS TANGENT VALUE, OIL AND GAS, POWER FREQUENCY VOLTAGE, AND LEAKAGE CURRENT. BY COMBINING THE ASSOCIATION RULES ALGORITHM AND THE EXPERIENCE OF THE FIELD OPERATORS, THE CAUSE–EFFECT RELATIONSHIP OF TEST DATA AND THE CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY PARAMETERS OF THE NETWORK ARE OBTAINED. THEN, THE BAYESIAN NETWORK IS CONSTRUCTED AND USED FOR TRACTION TRANSFORMER FAULT DIAGNOSIS.

FIRST, FORECASTING PERFORMANCE OF SVR MODELS CONSTRUCTED WITH A SINGLE KERNEL ARE COMPARED, AND THEN GAUSSIAN KERNEL AND POLYNOMIAL KERNEL ARE RETAINED DUE TO BETTER LEARNING AND PREDICTION ABILITY.

THIS PAPER AIMS TO PRESENT THE NUMERICAL INVESTIGATION OF THE COUPLED EM–CFD MODEL OF A LINE REACTOR (LR) WITH TWO COOLING SYSTEMS: AIR-BASED NATURAL CONVECTION COOLING SYSTEM (AN), AND AIR-NATURAL WITH WATER-FORCED COOLING SYSTEM (ANWF). THE DESIGN OF THE INDUCTOR COOLING SYSTEM WAS PRESENTED AND DESCRIBED. THE NUMERICAL INVESTIGATION OF BOTH COOLING SYSTEMS IS DONE CONSIDERING POWER LOSS GENERATION, COOLING EFFICIENCY, AND TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION. IN ADDITION, THE EM–CFD MODELS OF EXAMINED DEVICES WERE VALIDATED BY EXPERIMENTS CONSIDERING THERMAL MEASUREMENTS USING CALIBRATED THERMOCOUPLES, THERMAL IMAGE CAMERA, PRESSURE AND FLOW RATE MEASUREMENTS, WHERE THE TEMPERATURE WAS MEASURED IN AT LEAST 35 POINTS WITH PROBES. THE TESTS WERE PERFORMED FOR THREE OPERATING CURRENTS, RESULTING IN 100%, 75%, AND 50% OF TOTAL POWER LOSSES IN THE INDUCTOR. THE NUMERICAL MODELS REACH AN ACCURACY IN TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCE WITH RESPECT TO EXPERIMENTS WITHIN 5 K AND 3.5 K FOR AN AND ANWF COOLING, RESPECTIVELY.

THEREFORE, THESE TRANSFORMERS ARE WIDELY USED IN MANY CRITICAL APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS HOSPITALS, SCHOOLS, SHIPPING, AIRPORTS, DAMS, AND RENEWABLE ENERGY POWER PLANTS. HOWEVER, THE HEAT PERFORMANCE OF THESE TRANSFORMERS IS RELATIVELY POOR BECAUSE OF THE LOW THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY OF THE EPOXY RESIN MATERIAL THEY USE THAT SURROUNDS THE CORE AND COIL. IN ADDITION, ELECTRICAL LOSSES INCREASE WITH THE RISING POWER CAPACITY OF THE TRANSFORMER, SO THE LOSSES CAUSE OVERHEATING IN THE TRANSFORMER CORE AND WINDINGS. THIS SITUATION RESULTS IN THERMAL AGING AND INSULATION DETERIORATION THAT REDUCES THE SERVICE LIFETIME OF THE TRANSFORMERS. THUS, THERMAL ANALYSIS AND EFFECTIVE COOLING SYSTEMS FOR THE TRANSFORMERS ARE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE LIFE OF THE TRANSFORMERS. IN THIS STUDY, A 250 VA 380/110 V THREE-PHASE, DRY-TYPE TRANSFORMER WAS MODELED AND THERMALLY ANALYZED USING THE ANSYS/FLUENT PROGRAM. THE TRANSFORMER WAS ALSO TESTED UNDER LOAD CONDITIONS SO THAT THE THERMAL BEHAVIOR OF THE TRANSFORMER COULD BE OBSERVED VIA A THERMAL IMAGING CAMERA. IN ORDER TO DECREASE THE TEMPERATURE RISE IN THE TRANSFORMER CORE AND WINDINGS, DIFFERENT COOLING CONFIGURATIONS WERE TRIED BY CREATING A COOLING CABINET. THE OPTIMUM COOLING MODEL WAS DETERMINED THANKS TO EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES. THIS MODEL WAS ALSO VERIFIED BY SIMULATION RESULTS. IN DRY-TYPE TRANSFORMERS, THE PART WHERE THE TEMPERATURE INCREASES THE MOST IS THE MIDDLE LEG OF THE CORE AND COILS. THEREFORE, THE AIR INPUT THROUGH THE MIDDLE LEG OF THE CORE AND THE AIR OUTPUT THROUGH THE SIDE LEGS OF THE CORE PROVIDE THE GREATEST COOLING OF THE TRANSFORMER. THIS CONFIGURATION RESULTS IN THE MIDDLE LEG TEMPERATURE OF THE CORE VARYING BETWEEN 35°C AND 42°C. IN ALL OTHER FAN COOLING CASES, IT IS SEEN IN BOTH EXPERIMENTAL AND SIMULATION RESULTS THAT THE TEMPERATURE VALUES DO NOT DROP BELOW 47°C. THIS STUDY SHOWED THAT THE RELIABILITY, INSULATION, AND SERVICE LIFE OF THE DRY-TYPE TRANSFORMER CAN BE IMPROVED. © 2020, © 2020 TAYLOR & FRANCIS GROUP, LLC.","COOLING; COOLING SYSTEMS; DETERIORATION; EPOXY RESINS; FIBER OPTIC SENSORS; INFRARED IMAGING; OIL FILLED TRANSFORMERS; THERMAL AGING; THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY; THERMAL INSULATION; THERMOANALYSIS; TRANSFORMER WINDINGS; WINDING; COOLING CONFIGURATION; CRITICAL APPLICATIONS; EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION; INSULATION DETERIORATION; LOW THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY; RENEWABLE ENERGY POWER; TEMPERATURE INCREASE; THERMAL IMAGING CAMERAS; TRANSFORMER PROTECTION","COOLING TRANSFORMER; DRY TYPE TRANSFORMER; OPTIMUM COOLING; THERMAL ANALYSIS OF TRANSFORMER","F.

HOWEVER, THE POWER TRANSFORMERS IN SERVICE ARE SUBJECTED TO VARIOUS STRESSES LIKE THERMAL STRESS AND ELECTRICAL STRESS, WHICH MAY LEAD TO SEVERAL FAULTS SUCH AS ARCHING, PARTIAL DISCHARGE AND OVERHEATING. IN ORDER TO DETECT THESE INCIPIENT FAULTS AND ENSURE THE NORMAL OPERATION OF POWER TRANSFORMERS, THE DIAGNOSTIC METHODS BASED ON DISSOLVED GAS ANALYSIS (DGA) HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED. HOWEVER, THE DGA METHODS SUFFER FROM LOW DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY. ON THE OTHER HAND, WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI), A LOT OF INTELLIGENT ALGORITHMS HAVE BEEN APPLIED IN THIS AREA. HOWEVER, MOST TRADITIONAL AI ALGORITHMS ARE HARD CLASSIFICATION, WHICH MAY CAUSE THE WRONG DIAGNOSIS OF FAULTS. TO OVERCOME THOSE DISADVANTAGES, A METHOD BASED ON THE IMPROVED DS EVIDENCE THEORY AND MULTIPLE PROBABILISTIC OUTPUT ALGORITHMS IS PROPOSED IN THIS PAPER TO IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF FAULT DIAGNOSIS OF OIL-IMMERSED TRANSFORMERS. FIRSTLY, THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFT AND HARD CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS IS COMPARED AND ANALYZED. AFTER THAT, THREE DIAGNOSTIC MODELS BASED ON THE MULTICLASS RELEVANCE VECTOR MACHINE (MRVM), MULTICLASS SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (MSVM) AND BACK PROPAGATION NEURAL NETWORK (BPNN) ARE ESTABLISHED.

THIS PAPER SHOWS THAT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PROPOSED METHOD IS INDEPENDENT OF THE TRANSFORMER OPERATING CONDITION. THEREFORE, IT IS RELIABLE EVEN UNDER THE PRESENCE OF POWER SYSTEM TRANSIENTS SUCH AS THE EXTERNAL FAULTS. IN ADDITION, THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM CAN BE CONFIGURED UNIQUELY AND EASILY. THIS FEATURE PREVENTS THE ALGORITHM FROM UNNECESSARY TRIPS. THESE TRIPS CAN BE CONSIDERED AS THE GENERAL PROBLEM THAT MOST OF THE PAST PRESENTED METHODS FACE. THE EXPERIMENTAL TESTS USED FOR VERIFICATION OF THE ALGORITHM SHOW THAT, REGARDLESS OF THE TRANSFORMER WINDING CONFIGURATION AND ITS PRE-FAULT OPERATING CONDITIONS, THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM CAN ACCURATELY DETECT THE TTF, WHICH INVOLVES ONLY 1% OF THE WINDING TURNS, IN LESS THAN ONE CYCLE OF POWER FREQUENCY. THE RELIABLE AND SECURE PERFORMANCE OF THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM SHOWS THAT IT CAN BE WIDELY USED IN THE ADVANCED NUMERICAL RELAYS. © 1986-2012 IEEE.","ELECTRIC FAULT CURRENTS; ELECTRIC GROUNDING; ELECTRIC RELAYS; ELECTRIC TRANSFORMER TESTING; FAULT DETECTION; TRANSFORMER WINDINGS; WINDING; DIFFERENTIAL RELAY; INTER-TURN FAULT; NEGATIVE SEQUENCE PROTECTIONS; OPERATING CONDITION; PHASE-TO-GROUND FAULTS; POWER SYSTEM TRANSIENTS; TURN-TO-TURN FAULTS; WINDING CONFIGURATION; TRANSFORMER PROTECTION","DIFFERENTIAL RELAY; INCIPIENT INTER-TURN FAULT; NEGATIVE SEQUENCE PROTECTION","N.

IF THE TEMPERATURE MEASURED BY THE TRANSFORMER SENSORS EXCEED THE EXPECTED RANGES, AN ABNORMALITY MAY OCCUR.

TRANSFORMERS CAN BE REPLACED BASED ON THEIR HEALTH INDICES, BUT THEY DO NOT ALLOW UTILITY ENGINEERS TO QUANTIFY RISKS POSED BY TRANSFORMER FAILURES. IN THAT CONTEXT, THE STUDY PROPOSES A NOVEL RISK-BASED APPROACH TO PLAN THE REPLACEMENT OF AGED POWER TRANSFORMERS CONSIDERING THEIR TEMPERATURE, APPARENT AGE, AND EXPECTED CAPACITY. THE APPROACH COMPRISES A METHODOLOGY THAT INCORPORATES POWER TRANSFORMERS' WINDING HOTTEST-SPOT TEMPERATURE AND APPARENT AGE INTO THE CONVENTIONAL END-OF-LIFE FAILURE MODEL, A METHODOLOGY THAT CALCULATES THE EXPECTED CAPACITY OF POWER TRANSFORMERS, A NOVEL TRANSFORMER RANKING INDEX, AND A METHODOLOGY THAT CALCULATES THE OPTIMUM YEAR OF REPLACEMENT.

TRANSFORMER THERMAL MATHEMATICAL MODEL IS DEVELOPED AND DIFFERENT EV PENETRATION SCENARIOS ARE INTRODUCED AND SIMULATED. EACH PENETRATION SCENARIO SHOWS HOW A CERTAIN LEVEL OF THE EV CONNECTION AFFECTS THE LIFETIME OF THE TRANSFORMER. THE OBTAINED SIMULATION RESULTS ARE QUITE CRUCIAL FOR ASSESSING THE ABILITY OF THE CURRENTLY EXPLOITED DISTRIBUTION TRANSFORMERS TO FEED EVS BASED ON THE THREE CRITERIA: LOAD LIMIT, AGEING RATE AND TRANSFORMER LIFE LOSS. © 2018 IEEE.","ELECTRIC AUTOMOBILES; FOSSIL FUELS; HOTSPOT TEMPERATURE; REAL TIME MONITORING SYSTEM; THERMAL MODEL; TOP OIL TEMPERATURE; TRANSFORMER OVERLOADING; OIL FILLED TRANSFORMERS","HOT-SPOT TEMPERATURE; REAL TIME MONITORING SYSTEM; THERMAL MODEL; TOP-OIL TEMPERATURE; TRANSFORMER OVERLOADING","","","INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC.","","978-153865982-3","","","ENGLISH","INT.

POWER TRANSFORMERS ARE AMONGST THE MOST IMPORTANT EQUIPMENTS INSTALLED IN POWER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS. THEREFORE, THIS PAPER PRESENTS A NOVEL METHODOLOGY TO IMPROVE THE UTILIZATION OF SUBSTATION TRANSFORMERS. IN THIS METHODOLOGY, THE TRANSFORMER UTILIZATION OF A TWO-TRANSFORMER SUBSTATION IS INCREASED VIA RECONFIGURATION CONSIDERING THE SINGLE CONTINGENCY POLICY (SCP). THE ONLINE RECONFIGURATION HELPS TO MAXIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF LOAD TRANSFERRED FROM A SUBSTATION WITH A FAILED TRANSFORMER TO ITS NEIGHBORING SUBSTATION. THIS LOAD TRANSFER MAXIMIZATION PROVIDES HIGHER TRANSFORMER CAPACITY UTILIZATION POSSIBLE. IN THE PRESENTED METHODOLOGY, THE LOAD TRANSFER IS OPTIMIZED THROUGH TWO HIERARCHICAL STAGES. IN THE FIRST STAGE, THE BEST CONFIGURATION OF THE ASSISTING SUBSTATION IS ACHIEVED. THEN, IN THE SECOND STAGE, LOAD POINTS THAT CAN BE TRANSFERRED FROM THE SUBSTATION WITH A FAILED TRANSFORMER TO ITS NEIGHBORING HEALTHY SUBSTATION ARE DETERMINED. IN BOTH OF THE STAGES, THE RECONFIGURATION PROBLEM IS MODELED AS A MIXED INTEGER SECOND-ORDER CONE PROGRAMMING PROBLEM.

DURING THE PRODUCTION OF A TRANSFORMER, IT IS NECESSARY TO REDUCE ITS INSULATION'S MOISTURE CONTENT FROM ABOUT 8% TO LESS THAN 1% IN THE SHORTEST POSSIBLE TIME PERIOD. THE DRYING OF INSULATION IS A TIME-CONSUMING PROCESS, AND FOR HIGH-POWER TRANSFORMERS, IT CAN LAST UP TO THREE WEEKS. SEVERAL DRYING TECHNIQUES ARE USED DURING THE PRODUCTION OF A TRANSFORMER, AND ALL OF THEM REQUIRE HEATING UP THE INSULATION TO A HIGH TEMPERATURE AND APPLYING A VACUUM. UNFORTUNATELY, THE USE OF A HIGH DRYING TEMPERATURE ABOVE 100 °C CAN CAUSE A DECREASE IN THE DEGREE OF CELLULOSE POLYMERIZATION BY OVER A DOZEN PERCENTAGE POINTS. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A NEW CONCEPT FOR DRYING CELLULOSE INSULATION THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE HEATING INSULATION AND APPLYING A VACUUM. IN THIS SOLUTION, METHANOL IS USED AS THE DRYING MEDIUM.

THE MODEL IS BASED ON POWER CHARGEABILITY BALANCE AND SEEKS TO KEEP THE LOAD VOLTAGE WITHIN AN ADMISSIBLE RANGE. FOR ACHIEVING THIS, TAP POSITIONS ARE ADJUSTED IN SUCH A WAY THAT ALL TCP ARE SET IN SIMILAR/SAME POWER CHARGEABILITY. THE MAIN CONTRIBUTION OF THIS PAPER IS THE INCLUSION OF SEVERAL CONSTRUCTION FEATURES (RATED VOLTAGE, RATED POWER, VOLTAGE RATIO, SHORT-CIRCUIT IMPEDANCE AND TAP STEPS) IN THE MINIMIZATION OF POWER LOSSES IN TCP THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED IN PREVIOUS WORKS. A GENETIC ALGORITHM (GA) IS USED FOR SOLVING THE PROPOSED MODEL THAT IS A SYSTEM OF NONLINEAR EQUATIONS WITH DISCRETE DECISION VARIABLES. THE GA SCANS DIFFERENT SETS FOR TAP POSITIONS WITH THE AIM OF BALANCING THE POWER SUPPLIED BY EACH TRANSFORMER TO THE LOAD. FOR THIS PURPOSE, A FITNESS FUNCTION IS USED FOR MINIMIZING TWO CONDITIONS: THE FIRST CONDITION CONSISTS ON THE MISMATCHING BETWEEN POWER CHARGEABILITY FOR EACH TRANSFORMER AND A DESIRED CHARGEABILITY; AND THE SECOND CONDITION IS THE MISMATCHING BETWEEN THE NOMINAL LOAD VOLTAGE AND THE LOAD VOLTAGE OBTAINED BY CHANGING THE TAP POSITIONS. THE PROPOSED METHOD IS GENERALIZED FOR ANY GIVEN NUMBER OF TCP AND WAS IMPLEMENTED FOR THREE TCP, DEMONSTRATING THAT THE POWER LOSSES ARE MINIMIZED AND THE LOAD VOLTAGE REMAINS WITHIN AN ADMISSIBLE RANGE. © 2018 BY THE AUTHORS.","ELECTRIC LOSSES; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; NONLINEAR EQUATIONS; POWER TRANSFORMERS; CHARGEABILITY; CONSTRUCTION FEATURES; DISCRETE DECISION VARIABLES; POWER LOSS MINIMIZATIONS; SHORT-CIRCUIT IMPEDANCE; SOLUTION APPROACH; SYSTEM OF NONLINEAR EQUATIONS; TAP CHANGERS; TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL","GENETIC ALGORITHMS; POWER CHARGEABILITY; POWER LOSS MINIMIZATION; TAP-CHANGERS; TRANSFORMERS CONNECTED IN PARALLEL (TCP)","Á.

RENEWABLE ENERGY REPLACES THE CONVENTIONAL ENERGY SOURCES AT THE FAST RATE IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WORLD. DUE TO HIGH PENETRATION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY, THE INSTALLED TRANSFORMERS HAVE OBSERVATIONAL IMPACT ON THEIR INSULATION, LEADING TO DEGRADATION OF TRANSFORMER LIFE. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A CASE STUDY OF GUJARAT SOLAR POWER PLANT TO FIND THE IMPACT OF PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) PENETRATION ON TRANSFORMER PERFORMANCE IN THE TIME SPAN OF 1 YEAR. A PV PLANT HAS VARIOUS IMPACTS ON PERFORMANCE PARAMETERS OF TRANSFORMERS. THE WORKING OF ON-LOAD TAP CHANGER IS ALSO AFFECTED BY THE PRESENCE OF PV. THE MAIN CAUSE BEHIND THE ALTERED PERFORMANCE OF TRANSFORMER IN THE PRESENCE OF SOLAR PANEL IS ITS ASSOCIATED INVERTERS THAT ARE USED TO SUPPLY LINEAR LOADS. A HIGHER TEMPERATURE RISE WILL OCCUR IN THE WINDINGS AND CORES OF THE TRANSFORMER DUE TO VOLTAGE AND CURRENT HARMONICS, RESULTING IN EXTRA LOSSES.

THIS ALGORITHM IS BASED ON THE BEHAVIOR OF THE SECOND CENTRAL MOMENT (SCM) TO IDENTIFY THE KIND OF EVENT. INSTANTANEOUS DIFFERENTIAL CURRENTS ARE USED AS INPUT SIGNALS TO THE ALGORITHM ONCE THEY ARE FILTERED AND NORMALIZED. THE ALGORITHM COMPARES THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SCM WITH AN ESTABLISHED THRESHOLD BASED ON THE BINOMIAL DISTRIBUTION TO ACHIEVE A SUCCESSFUL IDENTIFICATION OF THE EVENT. IF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SCM IS ABOVE THE LIMIT, THE ALGORITHM IDENTIFIES THE EVENT AS A FAULT CONDITION. OTHERWISE, THE EVENT IS DETERMINED AS A TRANSIENT EVENT OR A STEADY-STATE CONDITION. THE THRESHOLD IS SETTING-FREE IF THE TRANSFORMER PARAMETERS ARE CHANGED OR IF THE HARMONIC CONTENT OF THE DIFFERENTIAL CURRENT VARIES. ALSO, THE THRESHOLD DOES NOT HAVE TO BE RECALCULATED IF THE POWER SYSTEM IS MODIFIED. THE D INDEX WAS INTRODUCED TO IMPROVE THE FAULT-DETECTION TIME WHEN THE CURRENT TRANSFORMERS EXPERIENCE SATURATION. THIS INDEX USES THE MAGNITUDE OF THE SCM AS A BASIS AND IS COMPARED WITH AN ESTABLISHED LIMIT TO DETECT THE FAULT CURRENT. BOTH INDICES RUN IN PARALLEL, AND IF ANY OF THEM DOES CROSS ITS RESPECTIVE THRESHOLD, A FAULT CONDITION IS DETERMINED. THE ALGORITHM IS TESTED IN A REAL-TIME DIGITAL SIMULATOR AND IS IMPLEMENTED IN MATLAB. THE ALGORITHM WAS COMPARED AGAINST THE CONVENTIONAL DIFFERENTIAL PROTECTION WITH HARMONIC RESTRAINT TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF BOTH INDICES IN CRITICAL CONDITIONS. THE RESULTS VALIDATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE ALGORITHM AND INDICATE THAT IT CAN BE THE BASIS OF A NEW ALGORITHM TO PROTECT POWER TRANSFORMERS. © 1986-2012 IEEE.","ELECTRIC FAULT CURRENTS; ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEM PROTECTION; FAULT DETECTION; POWER TRANSFORMERS; DIFFERENTIAL ALGORITHMS; DIFFERENTIAL PROTECTION; IN-RUSH CURRENT; REAL TIME DIGITAL SIMULATOR; RTDS; SECOND CENTRAL MOMENTS; STEADY-STATE CONDITION; THREE-PHASE TRANSFORMERS; TRANSFORMER PROTECTION","DIFFERENTIAL PROTECTION; INRUSH CURRENT; POWER TRANSFORMER; RTDS; SECOND CENTRAL MOMENT","H.

HOWEVER, FOR PRACTICAL PLACEMENT INSIDE A TRANSFORMER, THE SIZE AND FREQUENCY BANDWIDTH OF A UHF SENSOR FOR PD DETECTION ARE A WORRY. TO DETECT THE PD SIGNAL EARLY, SENSORS WITH HIGH SENSITIVITY AND MULTIBAND FREQUENCY ARE REQUIRED. SENSORS WITH HIGH SENSITIVITY AND MULTIBAND FREQUENCY ARE REQUIRED TO DETECT THE PD SIGNAL EARLY ON. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A VARIETY OF SIDE DIMENSION SIZES AND THICKNESSES OF A 4TH ORDER HILBERT FRACTAL UHF SENSOR FOR PD DETECTION INSIDE A POWER TRANSFORMER. THIS UHF SENSOR WAS DESIGNED TO CAPTURE PD SIGNALS AT FREQUENCIES RANGING FROM 300 MHZ TO 3 GHZ. THE SENSOR IS DESIGNED BY USING CST SOFTWARE WHERE THE SETTING THE DIMENSION OF 40 MM, 50 MM, 60 MM, 70 MM, 80 MM, 90 MM, 100 MM AND 150 MM FOR LENGTH AND WIDTH WITH DIFFERENT THICKNESS WHICH IS BY FIXED AND BY FORMULA WITH AN FR4 EPOXY SUBSTRATE OF THICKNESS 1.6 MM. BASED ON THE SIMULATION RESULTS, THE SUGGESTED SENSOR CAN MEASURE PD SIGNALS WITH A REFLECTION COEFFICIENT OF LESS THAN -10 DB AND A VSWR OF LESS THAN 5.

DURING THE OPERATION OF DT, THE INTERNAL TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION IS NOT UNIFORM. HOTSPOT TEMPERATURE IS THE MOST REPRESENTATIVE PARAMETER. IT CAN REFLECT THE TEMPERATURE CHANGE AND INSULATION AGING RATE OF THE DT TO GUIDE THE ACTUAL OPERATION. THE HOT-SPOT TEMPERATURE CAN BE CALCULATED BY BUILDING THE THERMAL CIRCUIT MODEL OF TRANSFORMERS. BOTH THE IEEE AND IEC STANDARDS PROVIDE METHODS FOR BUILDING THE THERMAL CIRCUIT MODEL BASED ON THE TOP OIL TEMPERATURE RISE AND THE BOTTOM OIL TEMPERATURE RISE. THESE THERMAL CIRCUIT MODELS ARE ALL SINGLE-PHASE MODEL. THEY ASSUMED THAT THERE IS NO HEAT EXCHANGE FOR EACH PHASE OF TRANSFORMERS WHEN THE THREE-PHASE LOAD ARE SAME. HOWEVER, THESE MODELS ARE NOT APPLICABLE TO THE THREE-PHASE UNBALANCED TRANSFORMERS. THE THREE-PHASE UNBALANCED OPERATION OF DT IS UNAVOIDABLE IN PRACTICE. IN ORDER TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM, A MODIFIED THREE-PHASE THERMAL CIRCUIT MODEL FOR DT WAS PROPOSED IN THIS PAPER. IT CONSIDERED THE INFLUENCE OF THE THREE-PHASE UNBALANCED OPERATION. IT MODIFIED THE TRADITIONAL THERMAL CIRCUIT MODEL WHICH IS BASED ON THE TOP OIL TEMPERATURE RISE. THE MODIFIED MODEL WAS COMPARED WITH THE STANDARD MODELS THROUGH THE ACTUAL EXAMPLES. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE MODIFIED MODEL PROPOSED IN THIS PAPER CAN REFLECT THE HOT-SPOT TEMPERATURE OF EACH PHASE FOR DT. COMPARED WITH THE TRADITIONAL THERMAL CIRCUIT MODELS, THE MODIFIED MODEL CONSIDERED THE EFFECT OF THREE-PHASE UNBALANCED OPERATION.

THE LIFETIME OF A TRANSFORMER IS MAINLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE CONDITION OF ITS SOLID INSULATION, WHICH IN TURN IS MEASURED AND DESCRIBED ACCORDING TO THE DEGREE OF POLYMERIZATION (DP) OF THE CELLULOSE. SINCE THE DETERMINATION OF THE DP INDEX IS COMPLEX AND TIME-CONSUMING AND REQUIRES THE TRANSFORMER TO BE TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE, UTILITIES PREFER INDIRECT AND NON-INVASIVE METHODS OF DETERMINING THE DP BASED ON THE BYPRODUCT OF CELLULOSE AGING. THIS PAPER ANALYZES SOLID INSULATION DEGRADATION BY MEASURING THE FURAN CONCENTRATION, RECENTLY INTRODUCED METHANOL, AND DISSOLVED GASES LIKE CARBON OXIDES AND HYDROGEN, IN THE INSULATING OIL. A GROUP OF SERVICE-AGED DISTRIBUTION TRANSFORMERS WERE SELECTED FOR PRACTICAL INVESTIGATION BASED ON OIL SAMPLES AND DIFFERENT KINDS OF TESTS. BASED ON THE MAINTENANCE AND PLANNING STRATEGY OF THE POWER UTILITY AND A WEIGHTED COMBINATION OF MEASURED CHEMICAL INDICATORS, A NEURAL NETWORK WAS ALSO DEVELOPED TO CATEGORIZE THE STATE OF THE TRANSFORMER IN CERTAIN CLASSES.

IMPROVING THE METHODS OF ESTIMATING THE INSULATION AGING OF THE OIL-IMMERSED POWER TRANSFORMER WINDINGS IS AN URGENT TASK FOR TRANSFORMER CONDITION MONITORING SYSTEMS. THE SCIENTIFIC NOVELTY OF THE WORK IS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE UNEVEN DISTRIBUTION OF TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY ALONG THE VERTICAL AXIS OF THE WINDING IN MODELING THE AGING OF INSULATION AND TO DEVELOP METHODS FOR DETERMINING THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THE AGING RATE OF INSULATION IN THE INTERMEDIATE LAYER WILL EXCEED AGING RATE IN THE HOTTEST LAYER. THE PURPOSE OF THE WORK IS TO EVALUATE THE WEAR UNEVENNESS OF CELLULOSE INSULATION BASED ON MODELING THE DISTRIBUTION OF TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY ALONG THE VERTICAL AXIS OF THE POWER TRANSFORMER WINDING. METHODS. THE TRANSFORMER WINDING IS MENTALLY DIVIDED INTO HORIZONTAL LAYERS OF EQUAL HEIGHT, THE REDUCTION OF SERVICE LIFE IS CALCULATED IN PARALLEL FOR ALL HORIZONTAL LAYERS. LAYER WITH THE MAXIMUM DEGREE OF AGING FOR THE ENTIRE PERIOD OF OPERATION AND STORAGE OF THE TRANSFORMER IS RECOGNIZED AS DETERMINING THE REDUCTION IN THE SERVICE LIFE OF THE INSULATION OF THE TRANSFORMER AS A WHOLE. A MODEL OF THE INTERACTION OF WINDING LAYERS IS DEVELOPED, WITH DETERMINATION OF TEMPERATURES, HUMIDITY, RELATIVE RATE OF AGING OF EACH LAYER DUE TO TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY AS A FUNCTION OF TRADITIONAL DESIGN PARAMETERS SUCH AS LOAD, COOLING TEMPERATURE, HEAT CAPACITY AND THERMAL RESISTANCE OF TRANSFORMER. THE INDEX OF EXCEEDING THE AGING RATE BY THE LAYERED METHOD IN COMPARISON WITH THIS RATE FOR THE HOTTEST LAYER IS OFFERED. THE METHOD OF GENETIC ALGORITHMS DETERMINES THE CONDITIONS FOR OBTAINING THE MAXIMUM VALUE OF THIS INDEX. RESULTS. A COMPUTER MODEL HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO PREDICT THE AGING OF THE CELLULOSE INSULATION OF TRANSFORMER WINDINGS. ACCORDING TO THE PROPOSED METHOD, A LAYER WITH SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTER INSULATION AGING TIME (IN THE EXAMPLE, TIME REDUCED BY 39.18 %) THAN FOR THE UPPER LAYER WAS DETERMINED, WHICH CONFIRMS THE FEASIBILITY OF LAYER-BY-LAYER MONITORING AND MODELING OF INSULATION AGING PROCESSES OF POWER OIL-IMMERSED TRANSFORMER WINDINGS.

DISCONTINUING MO APPLICATIONS IN TRANSFORMERS HAS INSTIGATED ALARMS TO DISPOSE OF WASTE TRANSFORMER OILS (WTOS) FROM IN-SERVICE/OFF-SERVICE; LACK OF TREATMENT MAY PREDISPOSE A LIFE ON EARTH TO PUT AT RISK. OIL DEGRADATION WAS STUDIED FOR WASTE TRANSFORMER OILS (WTOS) COLLECTED FROM VARIOUS SUBSTATIONS. THE CONTEMPORARY ANALYSIS USES MAGNETIC TREATMENT FOLLOWED BY A BIOPOLYMER-CLAY MICROCOMPOSITE, CHITOSAN-ACTIVATED BENTONITE COMPOSITE (C-ABC), AS AN EFFECTIVE ENVIRONMENT-FRIENDLY ADSORBENT. IN ADDITION TO BEING BIOCOMPATIBLE, THE C-ABC COMPOSITE’S EXCEPTIONAL ADSORPTION ABILITY—BOOSTED ACTIVE SITES AND HIGH SURFACE AREA—RESTORES THE DIELECTRIC CHARACTERISTICS OF WTOS TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE FOR BRAND-NEW TRANSFORMER OIL (FTO). THE RECLAMATION STRENGTH OF THE PROPOSED METHOD USING THE C-ABC MICROCOMPOSITE WAS COMPARED WITH THE CONVENTIONAL ADSORPTION MATERIALS. THE INTERACTION BETWEEN NEGATIVELY CHARGED CHITOSAN AND POSITIVELY CHARGED ACTIVATED BENTONITE SHOWS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE DIELECTRIC PROPERTIES OF WTOS. THE CIE CHROMATICITY COORDINATES STUDY CONFIRMS THE REMOVAL OF POLAR AND NON-POLAR COMPOUNDS. THE DIELECTRIC PROPERTIES AND CIE WERE FOUND TO BE IMPROVED AFTER CAREFUL INVESTIGATION PROCEDURES. ENERGY-DISPERSIVE X-RAY (EDX) SPECTROSCOPY STUDIES WERE USED TO EXAMINE THE ELEMENTAL ANALYSIS OF C-ABC BEFORE AND AFTER MECHANOCHEMICAL SYNTHESIS, AND SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY (SEM) WAS USED TO EXAMINE THE TOPOGRAPHY OF C-ABC. THE INVESTIGATED OILS WERE ALSO SUBJECTED TO FOURIER TRANSFORM INFRARED (FTIR) ANALYSIS. THE STATISTICAL STUDIES SHOW THAT AT 50% SURVIVAL, THE TREATED OILS SHOW A DIELECTRIC BREAKDOWN VOLTAGE OF 45 KV FOR WTO3, 42.5 FOR WTO2, 41.5 FOR WTO1, AND 40 FOR WTO4. THE MATHEMATICAL MODELS FOR THE INVESTIGATED OILS AND THEIR RESPONSE SURFACE SHOW INTERACTIVE EFFECTS BETWEEN THE PROCESS AND RESPONSE VARIABLES. MOREOVER, SWOT ANALYSIS SHOWS THE VARIOUS INFLUENTIAL FACTORS OF THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUE WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE SCOPE. HENCE, THIS PROPOSED METHOD IS ENVIRONMENT-FRIENDLY, AFFORDABLE, EASILY AVAILABLE, COST-EFFECTIVE, AND EFFICIENT FOR THE REMEDIATION OF WTOS.

AMONG CRITICAL ELECTRICAL ASSETS, THE POWER TRANSFORMER IS PROBABLY THE MOST REPRESENTATIVE. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A NOVEL METHOD FOR ESTIMATING A RISK INDEX FOR POWER TRANSFORMERS. THE PROPOSED METHOD IS BASED ON THREE FUZZY INFERENCE SYSTEMS (FIS), AIMED TO INTEGRATE EXPERT CRITERIA FOR THE CREATION OF RULES AND THE DEFINITION OF THE MEMBERSHIP FUNCTIONS OF THE ENTRIES. THE FIRST FIS IS DEDICATED TO THE CALCULATION OF A TRANSFORMER HEALTH INDEX (HI), BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE PHYSICAL-CHEMICAL TESTS NORMALLY PERFORMED ON THE INSULATING LIQUID OF THE UNITS. THE SECOND FIS IS ORIENTED TO THE DETERMINATION OF A CONSEQUENCE FACTOR (CF) OF THE FINAL FAILURE OF THE POWER TRANSFORMER, AND IT IS DETERMINED CONSIDERING ASPECTS SUCH AS OVERLOAD TO OTHER ASSETS, AVERAGE LOAD SUPPLIED BY THE UNIT, CRITICAL LOADS SUPPLIED, OIL VOLUME, PROXIMITY TO OTHER BUILDINGS AND PENALTIES FOR THE UNAVAILABILITY OF THE ASSET. THE LAST FIS COMBINES THE RESULTS OF THE PREVIOUS FIS, I.E., HI AND CF, TO PROVIDE AN ESTIMATION OF THE TRANSFORMER RISK INDEX. THE METHODOLOGY HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO PERFORM MANAGEMENT OF POWER TRANSFORMER FLEETS BY ALLOWING DECISIONS TO BE MADE, REGARDING INVESTMENTS, BASED ON RISK ASSESSMENT. THE PROPOSAL HAS BEEN TESTED ON A FLEET OF 15 UNITS. OBTAINED RESULTS SHOW THAT THE FIS FOR COMBINING HI AND THE CF LEADS TO MORE CONSISTENT RISK INDEXES, THAN THOSE OBTAINED WHEN PERFORMING THE CONVENTIONAL OPERATION OF MULTIPLICATION BETWEEN HI AND FC. © 2022 ELSEVIER B.V.","ASSET MANAGEMENT; ELECTRIC TRANSFORMER TESTING; FUZZY INFERENCE; FUZZY SYSTEMS; HEALTH RISKS; MEMBERSHIP FUNCTIONS; OIL FILLED TRANSFORMERS; POWER TRANSFORMERS; RISK PERCEPTION; ASSETS MANAGEMENT; CONSEQUENCE FACTOR; DECISIONS MAKINGS; FUZZY INFERENCE SYSTEMS; FUZZY INFERENCER; HEALTH INDICES; KEYPOINTS; POWER SYSTEM OPERATORS; RISK INDICES; RISKS ASSESSMENTS; RISK ASSESSMENT","ASSET MANAGEMENT; CONSEQUENCE FACTOR; DECISION MAKING; FUZZY INFERENCE SYSTEM; HEALTH INDEX; RISK ASSESSMENT","J.

IN THIS STUDY, THE EXPERIMENT IS CONDUCTED TO INVESTIGATE THE RELATION BETWEEN VACUUM AND IMPREGNATION PROCESS DURATION TO PARTIAL DISCHARGE VALUE OF 167 MVA 500/150 KV ON SINGLE PHASE POWER TRANSFORMER. TWELVE (12) SAMPLES ARE INVESTIGATED DURING MANUFACTURING PROCESS AND FINAL ACCEPTANCE TESTING BY MEASURING VACUUM AND IMPREGNATION PROCESS DURATION AS WELL AS THE VALUE OF PARTIAL DISCHARGE. THE RESULT SHOWS THAT VACUUM PROCESS DURATION HAS SIGNIFICANT EFFECT TO PD VALUES. COMBINED WITH OIL IMPREGNATION PROCESS OF THE INSULATION, THE RESULTS SHOW THAT TO ACHIEVE PD BELOW 70PC (<70PC), THE OPTIMUM VACUUM DURATION IS 57 HOURS AND THE OIL IMPREGNATION DURATION IS RANGED 75-120 HOURS. THIS PRACTICAL STUDY IS BENEFICIAL FOR BOTH THE OWNER AND THE MANUFACTURER OF PT, SO IT GIVES THE OPTIMUM DURATION FOR MANUFACTURING PROCESS TO GET LOWER PARTIAL DISCHARGE AT OPTIMUM DURATION AND COST. © 2019 IEEE.","ACCEPTANCE TESTS; BENCHMARKING; ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS; IMPREGNATION; INSULATION; MOISTURE; OIL FILLED TRANSFORMERS; POWER TRANSFORMERS; WELL TESTING; ACCEPTANCE TESTING; ELECTRICAL POWER SYSTEM; IMPREGNATION PROCESS; KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS; MANUFACTURING PROCESS; OIL IMMERSED POWER TRANSFORMER; OIL IMPREGNATION; VACUUM PROCESS; PARTIAL DISCHARGES","MANUFACTURING PROCESS; OIL IMPREGNATION; PARTIAL DISCHARGE; POWER TRANSFORMER; VACUUM PROCESS","C.

WITH THE RAPIDLY INCREASE OF THE ELECTRIC CONSUMPTION AND LOAD CAPACITY OF THE TRANSFORMER, HIGH HOT-SPOT TEMPERATURE HAS BECOME ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL ISSUES CONCERNED BY ENGINEERING MANUFACTURERS. THE DRIVEN FORCE OF OIL FLOW IS THERMAL BUOYANCY IN TRANSFORMER FOR OIL NATURAL /AIR FORCED (ONAF) COOLING MODE, BESIDES, THE INTERNAL OIL FLOW PATHS ARE COMPLEX. THEREFORE, THE HEAT DISSIPATION FOR ONAF TRANSFORMERS BECOMES A KEY INDEX DETERMINING THE LOADING POWER, AND IT IS OF GREAT THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE TO STUDY THE OIL FLOW DISTRIBUTION AND TEMPERATURE FIELD. IN THIS PAPER, THE FINITE VOLUME METHOD IS USED TO SIMULATE THE TEMPERATURE AND FLOW FIELDS OF A 110 KV ONAF TRANSFORMER. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE TEMPERATURE INSIDE TRANSFORMER INCREASES GRADUALLY WITH THE HEIGHT, AND THE HOT-SPOT IS FOUND LOCATED BELOW THE LOW-VOLTAGE WINDING TOP. THE VELOCITY OF OIL IN THE VERTICAL OIL CHANNELS ARE GREATER THAN THE HORIZONTAL OIL CHANNELS BETWEEN THE COIL DISCS. IT IS FOUND THAT INTRODUCING WASHERS IN THE TRANSFORMER DESIGN CAN ENHANCE THE FLOW RATE OF HORIZONTAL OIL CHANNELS AND STRENGTHENING THE HEAT DISSIPATION OF WINDINGS.

CONSEQUENTLY, THE INCREASING NON-LINEAR LOADS AFFECT THE ELECTRICAL TRANSFORMERS AND THEIR FACTORS DIRECTLY, LIKE IN THE DEPENDENCY BETWEEN TEMPERATURE AND HARMONIC INCREASE. THEREFORE, TO STUDY THE INFLUENCE OF HARMONICS IN THE TRANSFORMER'S TEMPERATURE, ONE SHOULD UNDERSTAND HOW IT WILL BEHAVE WITH THESE CHANGES IN THE ELECTRICAL POWER SYSTEM.

HOWEVER, THE INCREASED PENETRATION OF EVS IN THE GLOBAL TRANSPORTATION MARKET HAS LED INCREASED ELECTRICITY DEMANDS, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO AFFECT THE OPERATION OF ENERGY DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS. IN THE PRESENT PAPER, A DEMONSTRATION ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF UNCONTROLLED EVS CHARGING IN A CASE STUDY LOW VOLTAGE (LV) NETWORK IS DEMONSTRATED AND A FUZZY ENERGY MANAGEMENT STRATEGY FOR THE COORDINATION OF EV CHARGING IN LV NETWORKS IS PRESENTED, BY INCLUDING THE DISTANCE OF THE EVS FROM THE TRANSFORMERS IN THE FUZZY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS FOR THE FIRST TIME. THE INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS (IEEE) EUROPEAN TEST FEEDER IS USED AS A CASE STUDY LOW VOLTAGE DISTRIBUTION GRID. IN PARTICULAR, THE DEVELOPED SYSTEM CONFIGURATION TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE GRID, THE AMPACITIES OF THE LINES AND THE VOLTAGES AT THE SYSTEM’S BUSES. MOREOVER, ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE CONSIDERED AS AGENT-BASED MODELS, WHICH ARE CHARACTERIZED BY THE MODEL OF EACH EV, THE STATE-OF-CHARGE OF THEIR BATTERIES AND THE CHARGING POWER. IN PARTICULAR, AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE EFFECTS OF UNCONTROLLED CHARGING IS PERFORMED, IN WHICH TWO APPROACHES ARE EXAMINED. THE FIRST APPROACH INVESTIGATES THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF CHARGEABLE EVS IN THE CASE STUDY NETWORK AND HOW IT IS INFLUENCED BY THE GRID’S HOUSEHOLD LOADS. THE SECOND APPROACH EXAMINES THE NUMBER OF NETWORK UNDERVOLTAGES AND LINES AMPACITY VIOLATIONS IN A SET OF SIMULATION SCENARIOS. THE RESULTS OF THE FIRST APPROACH SHOW THAT THE DISTANCE OF THE EVS FROM THE NETWORKS SUBSTATION AFFECTS THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF CHARGEABLE EVS IN A SIGNIFICANT MANNER. BASED ON THE OBSERVED RESULTS OF THE TWO APPROACHES, A FUZZY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IS DESIGNED FOR THE COORDINATION OF EV CHANGING, WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE DISTANCE FROM THE EV CHARGING POINTS TO THE FEEDER SUBSTATION, THE STATE-OF-CHARGE OF THE EVS’ BATTERIES AND THE EVS’ CHARGING DELAY TIME. © 2020 BY THE AUTHORS.

THE INSERTION OF PEV5 IN HOUSEHOLDS WILL FACILITATE THE USE OF RENEWABLE SOURCES AND POSSIBLY CREATE ECONOMIC BENEFITS TO USERS, AS SHOWN IN A MEXICAN EXAMPLE HERE PRESENTED, BUT ALSO WILL INTRODUCE SOME CHALLENGES SUCH AS HOW THE PENETRATION OF PEVS AFFECT THE QUALITY OF EXISTING POWER GRIDS. THE CONTRIBUTION OF THIS WORK IS TO REVIEW THE LITERATURE IN REFERENCE TO THE POWER QUALITY PROBLEMS AND TO TEST THEM IN A REAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM BASED ON THE MUELLER COMMUNITY IN AUSTIN, TEXAS THAT HAS PEV5 AND PHOTOVOLTAIC PANELS (PVS). THE RESULTS SHOW THAT A COORDINATED DELAY CHARGE MODE REDUCES THE LOADING ON TRANSFORMERS AT PEAK HOURS AND IMPROVES VOLTAGE REGULATION.

ELECTRICAL VEHICLES (EVS) CAN HELP TO DE-CARBONISE THE ENVIRONMENT, BUT A DOWNSIDE IS THE TECHNICAL ISSUES PRESENTED TO THE LOW-VOLTAGE DISTRIBUTION NETWORK. TO QUANTIFY THE STOCHASTIC NATURE OF TRANSPORT-AFFECTED ELECTRIFICATION, PROBABILISTIC LOAD FLOW IS EMPLOYED. MONTE CARLO-BASED SIMULATION IS APPLIED TO ACCOMMODATE THE PROBABILISTIC UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH VARIABLE EV CHARGING PATTERNS. THIS STUDY CONSIDERS HIGH-POWER CHARGING (UP TO 11 KW) AT THE DOMESTIC LEVEL WHILE MONITORING POWER QUALITY VARIATIONS (VOLTAGE DROP, VOLTAGE UNBALANCE FACTOR, VOLTAGE SAG) STANDARDS. THIS WORK FOCUSES ON THE IRISH AND UK, DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM OPERATOR'S–TRANSMISSION SYSTEM OPERATOR'S PERSPECTIVES, AS IT WILL HELP TO IDENTIFY THE LIKELY IMPACTS DUE TO HIGH-EV CHARGER PROLIFERATION AT HOUSEHOLD LOCATIONS. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT IF A 3.68 KW CHARGER IS USED AT THE DOMESTIC LEVEL, IT IS POSSIBLE FOR 40% OF TOTAL HOUSEHOLD CONSUMERS TO CONNECT EVS DIRECTLY TO THE DISTRIBUTION NETWORK WITHOUT ANY POWER QUALITY BREACHES. FURTHERMORE, THE PROLIFERATION OF EV CAN BE INCREASED UP TO 100% IF CONSTRAINED TO THE START, AND MIDDLE PORTIONS OF THE NETWORK (RELATIVE TO THE FEEDER SUBSTATION TRANSFORMER).

AT MODERATE LEVELS OF PV PENETRATION, THE LOADING ON THE SUBSTATION TRANSFORMER DECREASES, AND THEREFORE THIS WILL HELP TO PROLONG THE LIFETIME OF THE TRANSFORMER. TO ESTIMATE THIS EXPECTED BENEFIT, A THERMAL MODEL FOR THE TRANSFORMER IS USED TO ESTIMATE ITS HOT SPOT TEMPERATURE AS THIS TEMPERATURE IS THE MAIN FACTOR AFFECTING THE DEGRADATION OF THE TRANSFORMER UNDER NORMAL LOADING CONDITIONS. TO ILLUSTRATE THE METHOD, A CASE STUDY IS GIVEN. A 10-YEAR PERIOD IS CONSIDERED FOR TRANSFORMER LOSS OF LIFE EVALUATION, WHERE PRACTICAL LOAD GROWTH AND PV PENETRATION SCENARIOS ARE CONSIDERED. THE SIMULATION IS CARRIED OUT ON A 15 MVA TRANSFORMER IN THE IEEE 123 BUS SYSTEM. SIMULATION RESULTS SHOW THAT PV PENETRATIONS BELOW 100% INDEED PROLONG THE TRANSFORMER LIFETIME.

THE CONSIDERABLE GROWTH IN THE DEPLOYMENT OF SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAIC PLANTS HAS GRABBED THE ATTENTION OF WORLDWIDE PROJECT DEVELOPERS, INVESTORS AND STAKEHOLDERS. IN THE WAY INDICATED, MORE DEVISED EFFORTS ARE ESSENTIAL TO WIELD THE GUARANTEE THAT SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAIC PLANT EQUIPMENT OPERATE TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT OF SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAIC ENVIRONMENT AND FACILITATE THE GENERATION OF ENERGY AS REQUIRED. ONE SUCH EQUIPMENT SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE HARMONICS AND DISTORTION GENERATED BY THE CONNECTED INVERTERS AND RESONANCES DUE TO THE NON-LINEAR LOADS IS THE STEP-UP TRANSFORMER. HARMONICS AND DISTORTION ARE WELL KNOWN TO INTRODUCE ADDITIONAL LOSSES, HOTSPOT TEMPERATURE RISE AND REDUCTION OF THE TRANSFORMER SERVICE LIFE. THE RISE IN HOTSPOT TEMPERATURE YIELD ABNORMAL LEVELS OF IGNITABLE GASES IN THE STEP-UP TRANSFORMER OIL SUCH THAT UNTIMELY FAILURES MAY TAKE PLACE. THE CONCENTRATION OF THIS GASES SUGGESTS PARTIAL DISCHARGE AND EXCESSIVE HEATING. RECENTLY REPORTED STUDIES EVOKE THAT THE DESIGNING OF SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAIC PLANT TRANSFORMERS BE MORE ROBUST. THIS PAPER INTENDS TO CONTRIBUTE ADDITIONAL KNOWLEDGE TOWARDS UNDERSTANDING THE ADVERSE EFFECTS RELATED TO HARMONIC CURRENTS IN THE STEP-UP TRANSFORMER FOR SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAIC APPLICATION. THE WINDING EDDY LOSSES AND STRUCTURAL PART LOSSES ARE EXAMINED UNDER A HARMONIC PROFILE TO COMPUTE THE SERVICE LOSSES AND RESULTANT THERMAL REQUIREMENTS. © 2020 IEEE.","HARMONIC ANALYSIS; OIL FILLED TRANSFORMERS; PARTIAL DISCHARGES; PHOTOVOLTAIC EFFECTS; SOLAR POWER PLANTS; THERMAL AGING; ADDITIONAL KNOWLEDGE; HOTSPOT TEMPERATURE; RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCE; SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAIC ENERGIES; SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAIC GENERATIONS; SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAIC PLANTS; STEP UP TRANSFORMERS; THERMAL REQUIREMENTS; SOLAR ENERGY","HARMONICS; HOTSPOT TEMPERATURE RISE AND SERVICE LIFE; LOSSES; SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAIC; STEP-UP TRANSFORMER","","","INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC.","","978-172812956-3","","","ENGLISH","IEEE INT.

HOWEVER, THE OPERATION MODES OF THE MAIN TRANSFORMER UNIT IN PSH ARE WAY MORE COMPLEX THAN THE CONVENTIONAL POWER TRANSFORMER, WHICH MAKES THE CONDITION MONITORING AND FAULT DETECTION OF PSH BECOMING A TECHNICAL CHALLENGE. IN THIS ARTICLE, AN OPERATION STATUS RECOGNITION MODEL OF MAIN TRANSFORMERS IN PSH BASED ON ARTIFICIAL VISUALIZATION OF MECHANICAL VIBRATION SIGNALS AND DEEP LEARNING IS PROPOSED. THE VIBRATION SIGNALS ON A SERIES OF 500 KV/360 MVA MAIN TRANSFORMERS OF PSH ARE MONITORED PERIODICALLY BY CONTACTING SENSOR ARRAYS. THESE VIBRATION SIGNALS ARE PROCESSED INTO NEPHOGRAMS BY USING LINEAR INTERPOLATION FITTING AND 1D TO 2D DATA MAPPING. A DEEP LEARNING METHOD BASED ON THE CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) IS USED TO CLASSIFY NEPHOGRAMS OBTAINED UNDER DIFFERENT OPERATION MODES, THAT IS, NO LOAD, FULL LOAD, DC BIAS, AND SHORT CIRCUIT. THE PROPOSED STATUS PREDICTION ALGORITHM WAS TRAINED AND TESTED THROUGH 150 SETS OF VIBRATION NEPHOGRAM SAMPLES, WHICH ENSURES THE FEASIBILITY OF THE NEPHOGRAM GENERATION METHOD AND THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CLASSIFIER. THE TESTING RESULTS SHOW THAT THE OVERALL STATUS PREDICTION ACCURACY FOR THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM ACHIEVES 89.7% WHEN THE NETWORK STRUCTURE IS OPTIMIZED. IT IS INDICATED THAT THE MECHANICAL VIBRATION OF THE MAIN TRANSFORMER HAS A PATTERN MATCHING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE OPERATING STATE OF PSH. IN PRACTICE, THE OPERATING STATUS OF PSH CAN BE DIAGNOSED REMOTELY BY EMBEDDED IOT SENSORS; THE HEALTH INDEX OF PSH CAN ALSO BE ESTIMATED BY WEIGHED ANALYSIS OF THE CHANGING TREND OF VIBRATION DATA OBTAINED IN THE LIFE CYCLE.

IN MANY UTILITIES, TRANSFORMERS HAVE BEEN OPERATING FOR MANY YEARS PAST THEIR EXPECTED USABLE LIFE. AS POWER DEMAND HAS SURGED, TRANSFORMERS IN SOME AREAS ARE BEING LOADED BEYOND THEIR RATED CAPACITY TO MEET THE DEMAND. ONE OF THE VITAL COMPONENTS IN A TRANSFORMER IS THE ON-LOAD TAP CHANGER (OLTC), WHICH REGULATES THE VOLTAGE IN THE DISTRIBUTION NETWORK. THIS STUDY AIMS TO REVIEW SEVERAL CONDITION-MONITORING TECHNIQUES (ONLINE AND OFFLINE) THAT CAN MONITOR THE HEALTH OF THE OLTC AND ASSURE THE SAFETY OF THE TRANSFORMER’S OLTC FROM IRREPARABLE DAMAGE BY DETECTING THE DEFECT AT AN EARLIER STAGE, WHICH IS PRECEDED BY THE SPECIFICATION OF TYPICAL FAULTS. THIS PAPER ALSO DISCUSSED THE COMMON FAULTS OF THE OLTC AND THE ROOT CAUSES OF THESE FAULTS. THE OLTC IS PRONE TO MECHANICAL FAULTS DUE TO ITS FREQUENTLY CHANGING MECHANISM IN THE TAP OPERATION. THE OLTC ARE ALSO PRONE TO OIL AS WELL AS THERMAL FAULTS. AS A RESULT, IT IS CRITICAL TO MONITOR OLTC CONDITIONS WHILE THEY ARE IN USE. PROPER MANAGEMENT OF CONDITION MONITORING (CM) FOR THE OLTC IS USEFUL AND NECESSARY TO INCREASE AVAILABILITY AND ACHIEVE OPTIMISED OPERATING. CONDITION MONITORING (CM) AND DIAGNOSTICS METHODS (DM) HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING SINCE THE 1950S. CM AND DM HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED TO DIAGNOSE AND DETECT AN INCIPIENT FAULT, ESPECIALLY FOR THE OLTC. MANY TECHNIQUES, ONLINE AND OFFLINE, ARE BEING USED TO MONITOR THE CONDITION OF THE OLTC TO PREVENT FAILURE AND MINIMIZE OUTAGES. THESE DM AND CM WILL PROLONG THE OPERATIONAL CYCLE AND AVOID A MAJOR DISASTER FOR THE OLTC, WHICH IS AN UNFAVORABLE SCENARIO. © 2022 BY THE AUTHORS.","DAMAGE DETECTION; DISASTER PREVENTION; ELECTRIC UTILITIES; OUTAGES; VOLTAGE CONTROL; CONDITION; DIAGNOSTIC METHODS; ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTION; ENERGY; INCIPIENT FAULTS; MONITORING METHODS; OFFLINE; ON-LOAD TAP CHANGER; ONLOAD TAP CHANGER; TRANSFORMER; CONDITION MONITORING","CONDITION MONITORING; DIAGNOSTIC METHODS; ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTION; ENERGY; INCIPIENT FAULT; ON-LOAD TAP CHANGER (OLTC); TRANSFORMER","F.B.

PEVS LOCALLY PRODUCE ZERO EMISSIONS AND THEY ARE MORE EFFICIENT IN CONTRAST TO INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE VEHICLES. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE IMPACT OF THE UNCOORDINATED CHARGING OF PEVS IS EXPECTED TO CREATE NEW CHALLENGES FOR THE ESTABLISHED DISTRIBUTION GRID. THIS ARTICLE INITIALLY EVALUATES THE IMPACT OF UNCOORDINATED CHARGING ON THE VOLTAGE REGULATION AND TRANSFORMER LOADING IN THE CITY OF HERAKLION, GREECE. THEN, A COORDINATED CHARGING STRATEGY IS PROPOSED TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF TRANSFORMER CAPACITY VIOLATION BY PEVS. TWO CASES WERE CONSIDERED WHEN THE TRANSFORMER OVERLOADING FROM PEV CHARGING WAS TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION: (A) KEEPING THE TRANSFORMER BELOW ITS NOMINAL CAPACITY LIMIT AND (B) KEEPING THE TRANSFORMER BELOW 90% OF ITS NOMINAL CAPACITY LIMIT. THIS WAS ACHIEVED BY DISTRIBUTING THE AVAILABLE CAPACITY (NOMINAL CAPACITY MINUS THE RESIDENTIAL LOADS) OF THE TRANSFORMER TO THE PEV CHARGERS IN A WAY THAT THE AFOREMENTIONED LIMITS WERE SATISFIED. REAL-WORLD DATA OF THE DISTRIBUTION GRID AND THE HOURLY POWER CONSUMPTION OF THE CITY WERE USED TO VALIDATE THE PROPOSED METHOD. RESULTS SHOW THAT POSSIBLE TRANSFORMER CAPACITY VIOLATION CAN BE TACKLED BY THE PROPOSED COORDINATED CHARGING, WITHOUT EXCEEDING THE VOLTAGE REGULATION LIMITS. © 2022 BY THE AUTHORS.

THUS, THE MONITORING OF TRANSFORMERS AND THEIR ANCILLARY EQUIPMENT, SUCH AS BUSHINGS, IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO IMPROVING THE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY OF THESE ASSETS. IN THIS CONTEXT, THIS PAPER PRESENTS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MONITORING SYSTEM FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF PARTIAL DISCHARGES (PDS), WHICH ARE A KEY PARAMETER IN THE ANALYSIS OF INSULATION CONDITION. PD MEASUREMENTS WERE PERFORMED USING THE ELECTRICAL METHOD. FOR THIS PURPOSE, A CAPACITIVE COUPLING DEVICE WAS DEVELOPED FOR BUSHINGS THAT WORKS AS A SENSOR FOR HIGH-FREQUENCY SIGNALS AND ALSO AS A PROTECTION APPARATUS TO GUARANTEE THE INTEGRITY OF THE BUSHINGS IN CASES OF EXTREME EVENTS, SUCH AS LIGHTNING SURGES. IN ADDITION, A COMPUTATIONAL ROUTINE IS PRESENTED THAT APPLIES A DIGITAL FILTERING PROCESS FOLLOWED BY A PROPOSED STEP FOR DIFFERENTIATING PDS FROM NOISES.

ESTER LIQUIDS, WHICH HAVE INTERESTING PROPERTIES SUCH AS HIGH FIRE POINT AND BIODEGRADABILITY, ARE GAINING NEEDED ATTRACTION. SINCE IN-SERVICE CONDITION, THERMAL AGING DETERIORATES THE PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES OF LIQUID DIELECTRICS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO STUDY THEIR LONG-TERM BEHAVIOR. IN THIS CONTRIBUTION, THE PRE-BREAKDOWN AND BREAKDOWN BEHAVIOR OF ESTER FLUIDS (SYNTHETIC AND NATURAL) UNDER AC STRESS ARE INVESTIGATED. IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTICS, SUCH AS PARTIAL DISCHARGE PRE-INCEPTION VOLTAGE, PARTIAL DISCHARGE INCEPTION VOLTAGE, BREAKDOWN VOLTAGE, AVERAGE STREAMER VELOCITY, AND INCEPTION ELECTRIC FIELD, WERE ASSESSED. THE INFLUENCE OF THE RADIUS OF CURVATURE (OF HIGH VOLTAGE NEEDLE ELECTRODE) AS WELL AS THE THERMAL DEGRADATION OF TYPICAL ESTER LIQUIDS ARE ALSO DISCUSSED. MINERAL OIL WAS ALSO INCLUDED IN THE TESTS LOOP AS A BENCHMARK FOR COMPARATIVE PURPOSES. IT IS FOUND THAT THE PRE-INCEPTION VOLTAGE OF ESTER LIQUIDS WAS, IN MOST CASES, HIGHER THAN THAT OF MINERAL OIL. FOR A GIVEN RADIUS OF CURVATURE, THE STREAMER INCEPTION AND BREAKDOWN VOLTAGES DECREASED WITH THERMAL AGING. DURING THE STREAMER INITIATION, THE ELECTRIC FIELD AT THE ELECTRODE TIP DECREASED WITH THE INCREASE IN THE RADIUS OF CURVATURE. THE VELOCITY OF THE STREAMERS SEEMS TO INCREASE WITH THE DECREASE IN THE RADIUS OF CURVATURE. THE PERIOD OF VULNERABILITY, THE SO-CALLED “DELAY TIME”, SEEMS TO BE INDEPENDENT OF THE AGING OR THE RADIUS OF CURVATURE FOR A GIVEN CONDITION OF THE LIQUID. © 2021 BY THE AUTHORS.

THE SOURCE LOCALIZATION BASED ON THE TIMES OF ARRIVAL WAS PREVIOUSLY STUDIED, COMPARING DIFFERENT STRATEGIES FOR SOLVING THE LOCATION EQUATIONS AND THE MOST EFFICIENT STRATEGY IN TERMS OF COMPUTATIONAL AND COMPLEXITY COSTS VERSUS PERFORMANCE WAS SELECTED FOR ANALYZING THE ERROR PROPAGATION. THE ERRORS OF THE ACOUSTIC EMISSION SOURCE LOCATION (LOCALIZATION PROCESS) ARE EVALUATED FROM THE ERRORS OF THE TIMES OF ARRIVAL (DETECTION PROCESS). A HYBRID PROGRAMMING ARCHITECTURE IS PROPOSED TO OPTIMIZE BOTH STAGES OF DETECTION AND LOCATION. IT IS FORMED BY A VIRTUAL INSTRUMENTATION SYSTEM FOR THE ACQUISITION, DETECTION AND NOISE REDUCTION OF MULTIPLE ACOUSTIC CHANNELS AND AN ALGORITHMS-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING SYSTEM FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LOCALIZATION TECHNIQUES (BACK-PROPAGATION AND MULTIPLE-SOURCE SEPARATION ALGORITHMS COULD ALSO BE IMPLEMENTED IN THIS SYSTEM). THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN BOTH SYSTEMS IS PERFORMED BY A PACKET TRANSFER PROTOCOL THAT ALLOWS CONTINUOUS OPERATION (E.G., ON-LINE MONITORING) AND REMOTE OPERATION (E.G., A LOCAL MONITORING AND A REMOTE ANALYSIS AND DIAGNOSIS). FOR THE FIRST TIME, DELAY ERRORS ARE MODELED AND ERROR PROPAGATION IS APPLIED WITH THIS ERROR SOURCE AND LOCALIZATION ALGORITHMS. THE 1% MEAN DELAY ERROR PROPAGATION GIVES AN ACCURACY OF 9.5 MM (DISPERSION) AND A MAXIMUM OFFSET OF 4 MM (< 1% IN BOTH CASES) IN THE AE SOURCE LOCALIZATION PROCESS. THIS INCREASES PROPORTIONALLY FOR MORE SEVERE ERRORS (UP TO 5% REPORTED). IN THE CASE OF A MULTI-CHANNEL INTERNAL FIBER-OPTIC DETECTION SYSTEM, THE RESULTING LOCATION ERROR WITH A DELAY ERROR OF 2% IS NEGLIGIBLE WHEN SELECTING THE MOST REPEATED CALCULATED POSITION. THESE AIM AT DETERMINING THE PD AREA OF ACTIVITY WITH A PRECISION OF BETTER THAN 1% (<10 MM IN 110 CM). © 2021 BY THE AUTHORS.

AMONG ALL THE DEVELOPED METHODS FOR PD MONITORING, THE ELECTRICAL PD MEASUREMENT IS THE ONLY RECOMMENDED METHOD BY THE STANDARD FOR THE ACCEPTANCE TEST OF TRANSFORMERS DUE TO ITS CALIBRATION POSSIBILITY OF THE CHARGE OF PDS, SPECIFIED AS THE APPARENT CHARGE. HOWEVER, THE SIGNIFICANT DEPENDENCY OF APPARENT CHARGES TO THE LOCATION OF THE PDS INSIDE THE TRANSFORMER WINDING MAKES THE DEFINING A PROPER THRESHOLD VALUE AS AN ACCEPTED PD LEVEL A DEMANDING TASK. IN THIS CONTRIBUTION, THE FEASIBILITY OF A NEW METHOD TO ESTIMATE THE CHARGE OF THE PD AT ITS ORIGIN IN THE WINDING HAS BEEN STUDIED. THE PROPOSED METHOD RECONSTRUCTS THE ORIGINAL CURRENT OF PD IN A LIMITED BANDWIDTH USING PD SIGNALS MEASURED AT TERMINALS OF A TRANSFORMER ALONG WITH THE SECTIONAL WINDING TRANSFER FUNCTIONS AND THE INPUT IMPEDANCE OF THE WINDING. THE ORIGINAL CHARGE OF PD WILL BE DETERMINED FROM ITS RECONSTRUCTED ORIGINAL CURRENTS. THIS CHARGE VALUE CAN PROVIDE A MORE ROBUST THRESHOLD VALUE FOR THE PD ACCEPTANCE TEST AS WELL AS A BETTER EVALUATION OF THE SEVERITY OF PD. ACCORDING TO THE PROPOSED METHOD RESULTS, THE ESTIMATED CHARGE VALUES ARE IN THE RANGE OF 0.26–1.88 OF THE ORIGINAL CHARGE OF PD, WHILE THE APPARENT CHARGE VALUES COULD BE 0.02 OF THE ORIGINAL CHARGE VALUE IN THE IEC STANDARD METHOD. © 2021 ELSEVIER LTD","ACCEPTANCE TESTS; ELECTRIC TRANSFORMER TESTING; PARTIAL DISCHARGES; PETROLEUM RESERVOIR EVALUATION; POWER TRANSFORMERS; WINDING; APPARENT CHARGES; FEASIBILITY STUDIES; INDUCED CHARGES; INPUT IMPEDANCE; INSULATING SYSTEM; LIMITED BANDWIDTH; PARTIAL DISCHARGE MEASUREMENTS; THRESHOLD-VALUE; TRANSFORMER WINDINGS","APPARENT CHARGE; CHARGE ESTIMATION; PARTIAL DISCHARGE (PD); POWER TRANSFORMER; REAL CHARGE; TRANSFER FUNCTION","S.

IN THIS PAPER, A TRANSFORMER BUSHING MODEL IS ESTABLISHED TO GAIN THEORETICAL INSIGHT INTO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE OF A COMPACT MULTILAYER BUSHING. TO EVALUATE THE BUSHING MECHANICAL STATUS, DIFFERENT SEALING CONDITIONS ARE TESTED BASED ON THE TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE MONITORING WITHIN THE PHYSICAL 110 KV BUSHING.

WITH DIFFERENT RELIABILITY COEFFICIENTS, GAS LEAKAGE AND OIL LEAKAGE ARE AVAILABLE TO BE FURTHER DETERMINED. THE PRIMARY AND AUXILIARY CRITERIA BASED ON OIL PRESSURE AND ITS GRADIENT ARE PROPOSED TO EVALUATE COMPREHENSIVELY THE ACTUAL SEALING CONDITION OF THE BUSHING, AND A WIRELESS OIL PRESSURE MODULE IS DEVELOPED AT THE BOTTOM VALVE, WHICH IS QUITE BENEFICIAL TO FIELD ONLINE APPLICATION.

AS A TOOL OF THE DEPENDENCE MECHANISM BETWEEN VARIABLES, A COPULA FUNCTION CAN EFFECTIVELY ANALYZE THE CORRELATION BETWEEN VARIABLES WHEN IT CANNOT DETERMINE WHETHER THE LINEAR CORRELATION COEFFICIENT CAN CORRECTLY MEASURE THE CORRELATION BETWEEN VARIABLE RELATIONSHIPS. IN THIS PAPER, THE EDGE VARIABLE OF A COPULA FUNCTION IS SELECTED FROM THE FAULT CHARACTERISTIC GAS OF A TRANSFORMER, AND THE DISTRIBUTION TYPE OF THE EDGE VARIABLE IS FITTED AT THE SAME TIME. THEN, BAYESIAN ESTIMATION WITH THE GAUSSIAN RESIDUAL LIKELIHOOD FUNCTION IS USED TO FIT THE PARAMETERS OF A COPULA FUNCTION AND A COPULA FUNCTION IS SELECTED TO DESCRIBE THE OPTIMAL DEPENDENCE OF THE FAULT CHARACTERISTIC GAS OF TRANSFORMER. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A COPULA FUNCTION AND THE STATE OF TRANSFORMER IS STUDIED. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE COPULA FUNCTION BOUNDARY WITH HYDROCARBON GAS AS EDGE VARIABLE CAN DIVIDE THE TRANSFORMER AS HEALTHY OR DEFECTIVE STATE. WHEN THE CUMULATIVE DISTRIBUTION PROBABILITY (CDF) VALUE OF THE DISSOLVED GAS IN THE OIL IN THE COPULA FUNCTION IS CLOSE TO 0.8, THE FLUCTUATION OF ITS GAS CONCENTRATION LEADS TO A SHARP CHANGE IN THE PROBABILITY.

THEREFORE, LONG-TERM EFFECTS AS LOADING AND AGEING SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN THE PROBLEM. THE MOST CRUCIAL REASON IN SUCH A LONG TERM PROBLEM IN POWER SYSTEM IS RELIABILITY ISSUES. ACCORDINGLY, IN THIS PAPER, LONG-TERM EFFECT OF LOADING ON TRANSFORMER FAILURE RATES HAS BEEN MODELLED AND DEMAND RESPONSE (DR) HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED TO REDUCE LOADING RATE OF THE SYSTEM. IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE EFFECTIVENESS OF DR, ITS IMPLEMENTATION COST HAS BEEN ADDED TO THE OBJECTIVE FUNCTION OF THE PROBLEM. IN ADDITION, REDUCING THE FAILURE RATE OF EXISTING TRANSFORMER MAY DECREASE THE NEED FOR A NEW TRANSFORMER SO THAT THE RELIABILITY OF THE SYSTEM HAS A DESIRABLE LEVEL. ON THE OTHER HAND, A DECREASE IN EXISTING TRANSFORMER LOADING RATE IN THE LONG RUN, MAKES THEM MORE VALUABLE AT THE END OF THE PLANNING HORIZON. HENCE, THE VALUE OF TRANSFORMERS SHOULD BE EMBEDDED IN THE OBJECTIVE FUNCTION.

THE DISSOLVED GAS ANALYSIS METHOD IS OFTEN USED TO OBTAIN GAS CONCENTRATIONS TO BE USED IN FAULT DIAGNOSIS IN TRANSFORMERS. TRADITIONAL METHODS HAVE BEEN USED FOR MANY YEARS TO DIAGNOSE SUPPLY USING THESE GAS DATA. HOWEVER, SINCE THESE TRADITIONAL METHODS CANNOT DIAGNOSE FAULTS IN SOME CASES, SMART METHODS SUCH AS MACHINE LEARNING METHODS HAVE STARTED TO BE USED. THIS STUDY PRESENTS A 523 SET OF DATA TAKEN FROM A REAL POWER GRID AND TROUBLESHOOTING STUDIES DONE USING TRADITIONAL AND INTELLIGENT METHODS. IN THE PRESENT RESEARCH, THE GAS RATIO AND GAS FRACTION USED IN TRADITIONAL METHODS ARE USED WITH MACHINE LEARNING METHODS. THE OBTAINED RESULTS ARE COMPARED TO EACH OTHER.

HOWEVER, DUE TO CONFLICTING MULTI-CRITERIA AND GOALS AND FACTORS, HIGHER STANDARDS ARE REQUIRED FOR GREEN DISTRIBUTION TRANSFORMER MANUFACTURING. HIGH STANDARD MANUFACTURING MAKES MANY MANUFACTURERS SHODDY THE INTERNAL COMPONENTS OF GREEN DISTRIBUTION TRANSFORMERS, RESULTING IN DISORDERLY COMPETITION IN THE MARKET, WHICH POSES GREAT CHALLENGES TO THE USERS' CHOICE OF TRANSFORMERS AND THE GOVERNMENT'S QUALITY SUPERVISION. THIS PAPER PROPOSES A CLOUD-BASED Q-RUNG ORTHOPAIR FUZZY MULTI-CRITERIA FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING THE GREEN DISTRIBUTION TRANSFORMER MANUFACTURING PROCESS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CONFLICTING RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CRITERIA. IT IS APPLIED TO RANK ORDER FOUR GREEN TRANSFORMER MANUFACTURERS IN CHINA BASED ON THE TWELVE MONO-CRITERIA UNDER FOUR CATEGORIES OF RESOURCE AND ENERGY UTILIZATION, PRODUCTION PROCESS AND EQUIPMENT, ENVIRONMENTAL COORDINATION, GREEN TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION, AND THEIR OVERALL PERFORMANCE RANKING RESULTS. OUR ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT RESOURCE AND ENERGY UTILIZATION AND GREEN TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION IS THE MOTIVATING FACTORS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF GREEN DISTRIBUTION TRANSFORMER MANUFACTURING AND EXPERT RECOGNITION, AND THE PRODUCTION PROCESS AND EQUIPMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL COORDINATION ARE THE INDUCING FACTORS THAT REDUCE THE QUALITY OF GREEN DISTRIBUTION TRANSFORMER MANUFACTURING AND THE RECOGNITION OF EXPERTS.

TO THIS END, EV OWNERS SUBMIT THEIR RESPONSE CURVES AND THE TARGET STATE-OF-CHARGE TO THE BEMS. THEN, THE TRANSACTIVE MARKET IS CLEARED TO DETERMINE THE MARKET-CLEARING PRICE FOR EACH EV, THE OPTIMAL EV CHARGING DECISIONS, AND ACCORDINGLY, THE SCHEDULING OF OFFICE BUILDING. ALSO, TO MODEL THE CORRELATED UNCERTAINTIES OF SOLAR POWER GENERATION AND DEMAND, THE DISTRIBUTIONALLY ROBUST CHANCE-CONSTRAINED METHOD IS EMPLOYED. MOREOVER, THE “BIG-M” TECHNIQUE AND THE PIECEWISE LINEAR APPROXIMATION METHOD ARE UTILIZED TO LINEARIZE THE OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM. FINALLY, THE CASE OF A BUILDING WITH 100 CHARGING PILES IS STUDIED. THE NUMERICAL RESULTS ILLUSTRATE A DECREASE IN THE TOTAL OPERATING COST OF BEMS AND THE RATE OF TRANSFORMER AGING COMPARED TO UNCONTROLLED CHARGING AND DIRECT CONTROL APPROACHES. © 2022 ELSEVIER LTD","BATTERY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS; CHARGING (BATTERIES); COMMERCE; ELECTRIC VEHICLES; ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS; OFFICE BUILDINGS; PIECEWISE LINEAR TECHNIQUES; SCHEDULING; SECONDARY BATTERIES; SOLAR ENERGY; SOLAR POWER GENERATION; BUILDING ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS; BUILDING ENERGY MANAGEMENTS; CHANCE-CONSTRAINED; CHANCE-CONSTRAINED APPROACH; CHARGING MANAGEMENTS; DISTRIBUTIONALLY ROBUST CHANCE-CONSTRAINED; ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING; NEW ENERGIES; TRANSACTIVE MARKET; TRANSFORMER AGEING; BUILDING; ELECTRIC VEHICLE; ENERGY MANAGEMENT; ENERGY USE; OPTIMIZATION; PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEM; PILES","BUILDING ENERGY MANAGEMENT; DISTRIBUTIONALLY ROBUST CHANCE-CONSTRAINED; ELECTRIC VEHICLE; TRANSACTIVE MARKET; TRANSFORMER AGING","H.

THIS CONVENTIONAL CRITERION MAY FAIL TO PERFORM PROPERLY IN SOME CASES WHICH RESULTS IN THE INCORRECT RELAY OPERATION. A NOVEL HIGH-FREQUENCY-BASED ALGORITHM IS PROPOSED IN THIS PAPER TO DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN THE MAGNETIZING INRUSH CURRENTS AND THE INTERNAL FAULTS. TEAGER ENERGY OPERATOR (TEO) IS USED HERE TO EXTRACT HIGH-FREQUENCY INFORMATION FROM THE DIFFERENTIAL CURRENT SIGNALS. DIFFERENTIAL CURRENTS RESULTED FROM AN INTERNAL FAULT HAVE MORE HIGH-FREQUENCY TRANSIENTS THAN THOSE RESULTED FROM A MAGNETIZING INRUSH AND THIS IS THE BASIC PRINCIPLE USED IN THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM. A VERY SIMPLE AND EFFECTIVE OPERATOR IS PROPOSED IN THIS PAPER TO QUANTIFY THE OVERALL HIGH-FREQUENCY TRANSIENTS OF A SIGNAL. THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM USES A QUARTER OF A CYCLE OF THE DIFFERENTIAL CURRENTS ALONG WITH THE VERY SIMPLE MATHEMATICAL OPERATORS TO DO ITS TASK. THEREFORE, THIS IS A VERY FAST AND SIMPLE ALGORITHM.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THE CONTROLLER IS TO CHARGE EVS WHILE KEEPING THE VOLTAGE OF DIFFERENT DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM POINTS WITHIN THE ACCEPTABLE LIMITS. MOST OF THE PROPOSED METHODS FOR CONTROLLED CHARGING OF EVS DEPEND ON THE AVAILABILITY OF THE COMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH ENABLES COMMUNICATION BETWEEN UTILITY OPERATOR AND EV CHARGERS WHICH IS NOT AVAILABLE IN THE CURRENT DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS AND REQUIRES A HUGE INVESTMENT. SO, AN AUTONOMOUS CONTROLLER WHICH DOES NOT NEED COMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE IS DEVELOPED IN THIS STUDY. THE CONTROLLER IS DESIGNED TO CHARGE EVS WITHOUT VIOLATING THE VOLTAGE LIMITS WHICH CAN OCCUR IN CASE OF UNCONTROLLED CHARGING OF EVS. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CONTROLLER IS TESTED ON A RESIDENTIAL LOW VOLTAGE (LV) DISTRIBUTION NETWORK AND THE SIMULATIONS ARE EXECUTED WITH MATLAB/SIMULINK. THE NETWORK PERFORMANCE IN CASE OF CONTROLLED CHARGING OF EVS IS COMPARED WITH THE UNCONTROLLED CHARGING OF EVS AND THE BASE CASE WHEN NO EVS ARE CONNECTED.

THE SAFE AND STABLE OPERATION OF TRANSFORMER IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE FOR THE RELIABLE TRANSMISSION OF ELECTRICITY GENERATED FROM RENEWABLE ENERGY AND FOR THE RELIABLE USE OF ELECTRICITY BY THE END USERS. THEREFORE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO ASSESS THE CONDITION TO AVOID THE FAULTS OF THE TRANSFORMER. IN THIS PAPER, A VARIABLE WEIGHT SYNTHESIZING ASSESSMENT MODEL IS PRESENTED THAT COMBINES THE G1 METHOD, THE ENTROPY WEIGHT METHOD, AND A VARIABLE-WEIGHT METHOD PROPOSED IN THIS PAPER TO ASSESS THE CONDITION OF TRANSFORMER BASED ON THE OFFSET OF THE TRANSFORMER EQUIVALENT CIRCUIT PARAMETERS. FIRST, WE PROPOSE DETERIORATION INDEXES ORIENTED TO THE MAINTENANCE MANAGEMENT NEEDS, WHICH CAN WELL REFLECT THE DEGREE OF DETERIORATION OF EACH TRANSFORMER COMPONENT. SECOND, THE VARIOUS DEFECTS OF THE TRANSFORMER ARE USED AS THE ASSESSMENT INDEXES, AND THE INITIAL WEIGHT IS GIVEN TO THE ASSESSMENT INDEXES ACCORDING TO THE DAMAGE DEGREE OF THE DEFECT. THE INITIAL WEIGHT IS CALCULATED COMPREHENSIVELY BY THE G1 METHOD AND THE ENTROPY WEIGHT METHOD. THEN, EACH INDEX IS SCORED ACCORDING TO THE OFFSET OF THE EQUIVALENT CIRCUIT PARAMETERS, AND THE WEIGHTS ARE ADJUSTED APPROPRIATELY ACCORDING TO THE SCORES OF THE INDICATORS USING A VARIABLE WEIGHTING METHOD TO EMPHASIZE THE SEVERITY OF THE DEFECT OR THE “SUB-HEALTH” CONDITION OF THE TRANSFORMER.

FIRST, SEVEN SETS OF VEGETABLE OIL-PAPER INSULATION SAMPLES WITH DIFFERENT MOISTURE CONTENT AND DIFFERENT DEGREES OF AGING WERE PREPARED, THE FREQUENCY DOMAIN SPECTROSCOPY (FDS) TECHNOLOGY WAS ADOPTED TO MEASURE THE FREQUENCY DOMAIN DIELECTRIC SPECTRUM AND CONVERT IT INTO A DIELECTRIC MODULUS SPECTRUM. THEN, THE FRACTIONAL MODEL WAS ADOPTED TO IDENTIFY THE PARAMETERS, THE CHARACTERISTIC QUANTITIES CLOSELY RELATED TO THE WATER CONTENT ΩC AND THE DEGREE OF POLYMERIZATION DP WERE SELECTED, AND THE FUNCTIONAL RELATIONSHIP WAS ESTABLISHED. FINALLY, AN FIELD VEGETABLE OIL TRANSFORMER WAS USED TO MEASURE AND TO PRELIMINARILY VERIFY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE METHOD. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS SHOW THAT THE FRACTIONAL MODEL CAN EFFECTIVELY SIMULATE THE CHANGING TREND OF THE DIELECTRIC MODULUS SPECTRUM, AND THE PROPOSED CHARACTERISTIC PARAMETERS ARE CLOSELY RELATED TO MOISTURE AND AGING. IN THE EVALUATION OF MOISTURE CONTENT, THE CHARACTERISTIC PARAMETERS Α, Β, MA AND ΩC ARE POWER-RELATED, AND THE CHARACTERISTIC PARAMETER Τ IS EXPONENTIALLY RELATED TO ΩC.

ONCE THESE CONSTRAINTS ARE VIOLATED, THE OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM MIGHT NOT WORK CORRECTLY AND MIGHT NOT CONVERGE TO A FEASIBLE SOLUTION, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SYSTEM INCREASES AND INCLUDES NONLINEARITIES. HENCE, THE ALGORITHM MAY NOT HELP IN MITIGATING THE IMPACT OF PENETRATING PEVS UNDER EXTREME CONDITIONS. TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM, AN ORIGINAL ALGORITHM IS SUGGESTED THAT IS ABLE TO ADAPT THE CONSTRAINTS’ LIMITS ACCORDING TO THE ENERGY DEMAND AND THE ENERGY NEEDED TO CHARGE THE PEVS. DIFFERENT CASE SCENARIOS ARE STUDIED FOR VALIDATION PURPOSES, SUCH AS CHARGING PEVS UNDER DIFFERENT STATE OF CHARGE LEVELS, DIFFERENT ENERGY DEMANDS AT HOME, AND DIFFERENT PRICING MECHANISMS.

THE NEED FOR EMISSION REDUCTION AND THE POTENTIAL OF EVS FOR THESE REDUCTIONS IS REFLECTED IN THE CURRENT SUSTAINABLE MOBILITY POLICIES OF THE EU AS WELL AS THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT. INCREASING THE PENETRATION OF EVS IN THE GRID REQUIRES AN EXPANSION OF EV CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE, WHICH IN TURN REQUIRES EITHER GRID REINFORCEMENT OR SOLUTIONS FOR MORE EFFICIENT USE OF EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE TO AVOID OR POSTPONE GRID REINFORCEMENT. DISTRIBUTION TRANSFORMERS FACE INCREASED LOADING DUE TO EV CHARGING AND NEED TO BE PROTECTED FROM OVERLOADING DURING PEAK LOAD PERIODS TO ENSURE CONTINUITY OF SERVICE. THEREFORE, TRANSFORMERS ARE ONE OF THE COMPONENTS THAT ARE UPGRADED OR REPLACED AS A PART OF GRID REINFORCEMENT. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE THE CONNECTION OF A SOLID-STATE TRANSFORMERS (SST) BETWEEN TWO BUSES OPERATING AT THE SAME-VOLTAGE LEVEL AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO REPLACEMENT OR UPGRADING OF CONVENTIONAL TRANSFORMER AS WELL AS TO PREVENT THEIR OVERLOADING.

THESE TRANSFORMERS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE RELIABILITY OF THE POWER GRID. ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF A TRANSFORMER IS INSULATING OIL.

SCHEDULED MONITORING OF TRANSFORMER OIL AGEING CAN IMPROVE THE STATUS OF THE TRANSFORMERS AND MAKE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO INCREASE THE RELIABILITY OF THE POWER GRID. THE MAIN REASONS FOR OIL AGEING ARE THERMAL AND ELECTRICAL PRESSURES. THESE TENSIONS CAUSE CHEMICAL DEGRADATION OF THE OIL.

A CONVENIENT WAY OF ANALYSING TIME-DOMAIN DIELECTRIC RESPONSE Φ(T) IS THE FORMULATION OF SIMPLE RESISTANCE −CAPACITANCE-BASED CIRCUITS LIKE THE CONVENTIONAL DEBYE MODEL (CDM) OR THE MODIFIED DEBYE MODEL (MDM) THAT ARE CAPABLE OF MODELLING Φ(T). HOWEVER, AVAILABLE TECHNIQUES DO NOT GUARANTEE UNIQUE BRANCH PARAMETERS OF SUCH CIRCUITS FOR A GIVEN Φ(T).

THIS PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO THE KNOWLEDGE REGARDING THE OPERATIONAL PROCESS OF FUTURE POWER NETWORKS BY DEVELOPING A REALISTIC AND STOCHASTIC CHARGING MODEL OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES (EVS). LARGE-SCALE INTEGRATION OF EVS INTO RESIDENTIAL DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS (RDNS) IS AN EVOLVING ISSUE OF PARAMOUNT SIGNIFICANCE FOR UTILITY OPERATORS. UNBALANCED VOLTAGES PREVENT EFFECTIVE AND RELIABLE OPERATION OF RDNS. DIVERSIFIED EV LOADS REQUIRE A STOCHASTIC APPROACH TO PREDICT EVS CHARGING DEMAND, CONSEQUENTLY, A PROBABILISTIC MODEL IS DEVELOPED TO ACCOUNT SEVERAL REALISTIC ASPECTS COMPRISING CHARGING TIME, BATTERY CAPACITY, DRIVING MILEAGE, STATE-OF-CHARGE, TRAVELING FREQUENCY, CHARGING POWER, AND TIME-OF-USE MECHANISM UNDER PEAK AND OFF-PEAK CHARGING STRATEGIES. AN ATTEMPT IS MADE TO EXAMINE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH RDNS BY APPLYING A STOCHASTIC MODEL OF EVS CHARGING PATTERN. THE OUTPUT OF EV STOCHASTIC MODEL OBTAINED FROM MONTE-CARLO SIMULATIONS IS UTILIZED TO EVALUATE THE POWER QUALITY PARAMETERS OF RDNS. THE EQUIPMENT CAPABILITY OF RDNS MUST BE EVALUATED TO DETERMINE THE POTENTIAL OVERLOADS. PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATIONS OF RDNS INCLUDING VOLTAGE UNBALANCE FACTOR, VOLTAGE BEHAVIOR, DOMESTIC TRANSFORMER LIMITS AND FEEDER LOSSES ARE ASSESSED IN CONTEXT TO EV CHARGING SCENARIOS WITH VARIOUS CHARGING POWER LEVELS AT DIFFERENT PENETRATION LEVELS. MOREOVER, THE IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF EVS ON RDNS IS FOUND TO MAJORLY RELY ON THE TYPE AND LOCATION OF A POWER NETWORK. © 2019, HIGHER EDUCATION PRESS AND SPRINGER-VERLAG GMBH GERMANY, PART OF SPRINGER NATURE.","","ELECTRIC VEHICLES (EVS); RESIDENTIAL DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS (RDNS); STATE-OF CHARGE (SOC); TIME-OF-USE (TOU); VOLTAGE UNBALANCE FACTOR (VUF)","S.

TRAVELING BY ELECTRIC VEHICLES (EVS) INSTEAD OF CONVENTIONAL FUEL CARS IS STRONGLY SUPPORTED BY NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS FOR THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF URBAN TRANSPORTATION. HOWEVER, THE INCREASING EV CHARGING LOAD IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS HAVE BROUGHT A HEAVY BURDEN TO THE DISTRIBUTION TRANSFORMER. THEREFORE, COORDINATED CHARGING OF EVS IN THE RESIDENTIAL CHARGING STATION (RCS) IS ESSENTIAL TO RELIEVE THE POWER SUPPLY PRESSURE. IN THIS PAPER, AN OPTIMAL CHARGING STRATEGY BASED ON DYNAMIC SPIKE PRICING (DSP) POLICY IS PROPOSED TO REDUCE THE CHARGING COST OF EVS AND ENSURE THE NORMAL OPERATION OF THE DISTRIBUTION TRANSFORMER. FIRST OF ALL, THE LOAD MODEL OF EVS ON FOUR KINDS OF TYPICAL DAYS IS ESTABLISHED WITH CONSIDERATION OF THE SEASONAL AND HOLIDAY CHARACTERISTICS OF EV CHARGING DEMANDS. THEN, A NEW DSP POLICY BASED ON TIME-OF-USE (TOU) MECHANISM IS DESIGNED WITH AN ADDITIONAL SPIKE TIME PERIOD AND A SPIKE PRICE TO TRANSFER PEAK LOADS IN RUSH HOURS. TO PROTECT EV USERS FROM FINANCIAL LOSSES AND PREVENT TRANSFORMER OVERLOAD, AN OPTIMAL CHARGING MODEL IS FORMULATED TO MINIMIZE THE CHARGING COST OF EVS WITH CONSIDERING THE POWER MARGIN OF THE DISTRIBUTION TRANSFORMER. ULTIMATELY, THE GENETIC ALGORITHM (GA) IS USED TO SOLVE THE MODEL.

HOWEVER, DUE TO TECHNOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS LINKED TO VOLTAGE AND CURRENTS, THE PV HOSTING CAPACITY HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY CONSTRAINED. THEREFORE, THIS PAPER PROPOSES A COMPETENT APPROACH TO MAXIMIZE PV HOSTING CAPACITY IN A LOW VOLTAGE DISTRIBUTION NETWORK BASED ON VOLTAGE CONTROL AND DYNAMIC LINE RATING OF THE CABLES. COORDINATED VOLTAGE CONTROL IS APPLIED WITH AN ON-LOAD TAP CHANGING TRANSFORMER, AND REACTIVE POWER COMPENSATION AND ACTIVE POWER CURTAILMENT OF PV INVERTERS. A CASE STUDY WITH PROBABILISTIC AND DETERMINISTIC ASSESSMENTS IS CARRIED OUT ON A REAL SRI LANKAN NETWORK TO SHOW HOW THE PV HOSTING CAPACITY IS CONSTRAINED. THE FINDINGS REVEALED THE CAPABILITY OF INTEGRATED VOLTAGE CONTROL SCHEMES AND DYNAMIC LINE RATING IN MAXIMIZING HOSTING CAPACITY. THE STUDY IS EXPANDED BY INCORPORATING THE PV REPHASING APPROACH IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED CONTROL TECHNIQUES, AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PV-REPHASING IS CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED. WHEN COMPARED TO VOLTAGE CONTROL AND CONDUCTOR STATIC RATING, THE COMBINED REPHASING, VOLTAGE CONTROL, AND DLR YIELDED A 60% INCREASE IN PV HOSTING CAPACITY. © 2021 BY THE AUTHORS.

THE STREAMER CHARACTERISTICS WERE ASSESSED MAINLY ON THE BASIS OF REGISTRATION OF LIGHT EMITTED DURING STREAMER DEVELOPMENT AND ADDITIONALLY ON THE BASIS OF PROPAGATION VELOCITY EVALUATED. THREE LIQUIDS WERE TESTED DURING THE STUDIES NAMELY MINERAL OIL, SYNTHETIC ESTER AND NATURAL ESTER. A NON-UNIFORM ELECTRIC FIELD WAS CREATED BY POINT-TO-SPHERE ELECTRODE SYSTEM, A STANDARD PRACTICE IN LABORATORY, ALTHOUGH VERY MUCH UNLIKELY TAKEN PLACE IN REAL TRANSFORMERS. TWO LIQUID GAPS 20 MM AND 40 MM WERE CONSIDERED. THE STUDIES INCLUDED LIBV DETERMINATION OF FREE LIQUID GAPS, ACCELERATION VOLTAGE DETERMINATION IN EACH CASE AND STREAMER BEHAVIOR ASSESSMENT WHEN 4 MM IN THICK PRESSBOARD BARRIER WAS PLACED 10 MM BELOW HV TIP. THE RESULTS SHOWED THE DIFFERENCES IN LIBV OF THE LIQUIDS CONSIDERED IN FAVOR OF NATURAL ESTER FOR 20 MM GAP AND IN FAVOR OF MINERAL OIL FOR 40 MM GAP. HOWEVER WHEN COMPARING ACCELERATION VOLTAGE MUCH BETTER PROPERTIES INDICATED MINERAL OIL TESTED, WHAT WAS EXPECTED BASED ON LITERATURE DATA. WHEN INTRODUCING THE PRESSBOARD BARRIER THE STREAMERS SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED THEIR CHARACTERISTICS IN RELATION TO THE SYSTEM WITHOUT BARRIER. IN MOST CASES, AT THE VALUES OF THE VOLTAGE AT WHICH THE STREAMERS DEVELOPED AS FAST, THEY HAVE BEEN SLOWED DOWN. ADDITIONALLY, THE DIFFERENCES IN BREAKDOWN VOLTAGE WHEN BARRIER INTRODUCING WERE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED.

THIS PAPER PROPOSES A NOVEL FAULT DIAGNOSIS METHOD CALLED THE EXPERTISE-GUIDED MACHINE LEARNING (EGML) MODEL WHERE A GENETIC ALGORITHM (GA) AND A MIND EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM (MEA) ARE USED AS OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHMS. THEREBY, TWO TYPES OF EGML MODELS ARE GENERATED, THAT IS, THE GA-EGML MODEL AND THE MEA-EGML MODEL. IN THE EGML MODEL, KNOWLEDGE FUNCTION REPLACES THE COST FUNCTION OF TRADITIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ALGORITHMS, WHICH CAN PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL AND BRING SOME CORRECTIONS TO THE PREDICTION RESULTS. TO INVESTIGATE THE APPLICATION POTENTIALS OF THE PROPOSED MODELS IN POWER TRANSFORMER FAULT DIAGNOSIS, REAL DISSOLVED GASES DATA ARE UTILIZED TO EVALUATE THE DIAGNOSIS PERFORMANCE OF THE PROPOSED MODELS. RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE EGML MODEL OUTPERFORMS THE TRADITIONAL BACK PROPAGATION NEURAL NETWORK (BPNN) MODEL AND ALL OTHER MODELS PARTICIPATING IN THE COMPARISON. BOTH THE GA-EGML MODEL AND MEA-EGML MODEL CAN BE USED TO DIAGNOSE THE FAULTS OF A POWER TRANSFORMER, AND THE LATTER IS BETTER. IN ADDITION, TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE PROPOSED MODELS FOR DIFFERENT DATA, FOUR SCENARIOS ARE SIMULATED.

IN SUCH AREAS, LOW VOLTAGE LINES ARE USED FOR LONG DISTANCES, WHICH CAUSE POWER LOSSES AND VOLTAGE DROP FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONSUMERS. REDUCING LOSSES AND IMPROVING VOLTAGE PROFILES IN RURAL DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS ARE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES FOR ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTION COMPANIES. HOWEVER DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS WERE PROPOSED IN THE LITERATURE TO OVERCOME THESE CHALLENGES, MOST OF THEM FACE DIFFICULTIES WHEN APPLIED IN THE CONVENTIONAL DISTRIBUTION NETWORK. TO ADDRESS THE ABOVE ISSUES, AN APPLICABLE SOLUTION IS PROPOSED IN THIS PAPER BY INSTALLING A NUMBER OF SMALL-CAPACITY DISTRIBUTION TRANSFORMERS INSTEAD OF EVERY SINGLE LARGE-CAPACITY TRANSFORMER IN RURAL AREAS. THE PROPOSED APPROACH IS IMPLEMENTED IN THE BRANCH NETWORK OF AL-HOQOOL VILLAGE, WHICH BELONGS TO THE NINEVEH DISTRIBUTION NETWORK. THE NETWORK HAS BEEN INSPECTED ON-SITE, DRAWN, AND ANALYZED USING THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS ANALYSIS PROGRAM (ETAP). THE ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT USING THE SINGLE-PHASE POLE-MOUNTED TRANSFORMERS CAN IMPROVE THE VOLTAGE IN THE NETWORK’S END BY 29% AND ENHANCE THE VOLTAGE PROFILE FOR ALL CONSUMERS. THE ANALYSIS HAS ALSO DEMONSTRATED THAT THE MODIFICATION CAN REDUCE THE TOTAL POWER LOSSES BY 78% COMPARED TO THE EXISTING NETWORK. CONCERNING THE ECONOMIC ASPECT, THE PAYBACK PERIOD FOR THE PROPOSED NETWORK IS ASSIGNED TO BE 20 MONTHS. © 2022, TECH SCIENCE PRESS.

TO REDUCE FAILURES AND EXTEND THE SERVICE LIFE OF POWER TRANSFORMERS IN OPERATION, THE ISSUE OF ENHANCING THE TECHNIQUES FOR ASSESSING THE CONDITION OF THEIR INTERNAL INSULATION BECOMES RELEVANT. CURRENTLY, WHEN SELECTING THE MAJOR INSULATION OF TRANSFORMERS, ONE TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE DEPENDENCY OF THE DIELECTRIC STRENGTH OF THE OIL PASSAGE ON ITS WIDTH. EXPERTS DISCUSS THE ISSUES INVOLVED IN THE CHOICE OF MAJOR INSULATION WHILE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE EFFECT OF THE GENERALIZED FACTOR BEING THE VOLUME OF THE OIL PASSAGE. THE SOLUTION TO THAT PROBLEM LARGELY DEPENDS ON THE STUDY OF THE STATISTICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DIELECTRIC STRENGTH OF OIL PASSAGES OF DIFFERENT VOLUMES AND THE EFFECT RATED PARAMETERS OF TRANSFORMERS HAVE ON THEM. THE EFFICIENCY OF THE APPLICATION OF SUCH DIAGNOSTIC CHARACTERISTICS DEPENDS ON THE EXTENT OF STUDIES AVAILABLE ON THEM AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THEIR STANDARDIZED PARAMETERS. THE PAPER PROPOSES A METHOD FOR ESTIMATING THE CHANGE IN THE TRANSFORMER OIL VOLUME IN STRESSED OIL PASSAGES OF MAJOR INSULATION OF HIGH-VOLTAGE POWER TRANSFORMERS AND STATISTICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DIELECTRIC STRENGTH OF THESE PASSAGES WHILE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE EFFECT OF THE RATED VALUES OF CAPACITY AND VOLTAGE OF TRANSFORMERS. IT IS SHOWN THAT THE DEGREE OF EFFECT OF TRANSFORMER TECHNICAL PARAMETERS ON THE STATISTICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DIELECTRIC STRENGTH OF OIL PASSAGES DEPENDS ON THE QUALITY OF TRANSFORMER OIL, WHICH UNDERGOES A CHANGE IN OPERATING CONDITIONS. © 2022 BY THE AUTHORS.

THE HOT-SPOT TEMPERATURE IS A PRIMARY FACTOR AFFECTING THE RELIABILITY AND SERVICE LIFE OF POWER TRANSFORMERS. IN ORDER TO CALCULATE THE TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION OF OIL-IMMERSED TRANSFORMER WINDINGS ACCURATELY, IT IS REQUIRED TO SOLVE A MULTI-PHYSICAL PROBLEM, IN WHICH THE MAGNETIC FIELD AND THE FLUID-TEMPERATURE FIELD ARE COUPLED. IN THE SIMULATION OF MULTI-PHYSICAL FIELD OF TRANSFORMER, MANY STUDIES USUALLY OMIT THE TURN-TO-TURN INSULATION OF WINDINGS TO SIMPLIFY THE OIL-IMMERSED TRANSFORMER MODEL. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF THE TURN-TO-TURN INSULATION OF WINDINGS IN OIL-IMMERSED TRANSFORMERS ON THE SIMULATION RESULTS. FIRST, A 2D AXISYMMETRIC TRANSFORMER MODEL WAS ESTABLISHED IN ANSYS TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF LOW-VOLTAGE WINDING TURN-TO-TURN INSULATION ON THE MAGNETIC FIELD SIMULATION RESULTS. THE DIFFERENCES OF EDDY CURRENT LOSSES IN THE SIMULATION WERE ALSO CALCULATED IN TERMS OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD SIMULATION RESULTS. IT IS FOUND THAT THE TURN-TO-TURN INSULATION DOES NOT AFFECT THE MAGNETIC FIELD DISTRIBUTION IN EVIDENCE FROM THE SIMULATION RESULTS. BESIDES, THE VALUES OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD AND EDDY CURRENT LOSS APPEAR SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES ONLY AT BOTH ENDS OF THE LOW-VOLTAGE WINDING. SECOND, THE FLUID-TEMPERATURE FIELD OF THE TRANSFORMER WAS SOLVED IN FLUENT AND THE TURN-TO-TURN INSULATION WAS THE CONTROLLED OBJECTIVE IN THE SOLUTION PROCESS WITH CONSIDERATION OF THE DIFFERENCE IN WINDING LOSSES. THE SIMULATION RESULTS SHOW THAT THE TURN-TO-TURN INSULATION OF THE WINDING DOES NOT CHANGE THE OIL FLOW DISTRIBUTION IN SIMULATION. THE SIMULATION MODEL WITH TURN-TO-TURN INSULATION APPEARS A GRADIENT IN THE TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION OF THE DISCS AND A RISE IN THE OVERALL TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION. MOREOVER, THIS PAPER ANALYZES THE POSSIBLE REASONS FOR THE DIFFERENCES IN THE SIMULATION RESULTS OF THE MAGNETIC AND TEMPERATURE FIELDS CAUSED BY THE TURN-TO-TURN INSULATION. SOME RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS IN THIS PAPER CAN BE USED IN RELATED STUDIES AND DESIGNS. © 2020 IEEE.","EDDY CURRENT TESTING; ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEM ECONOMICS; ELECTRIC POWER TRANSMISSION; ELECTRIC POWER TRANSMISSION NETWORKS; ENERGY CONVERSION; INSULATION; LOSSES; MAGNETIC FIELDS; OIL FILLED TRANSFORMERS; POWER TRANSFORMERS; TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION; WINDING; CONTROLLED OBJECTIVE; LOW VOLTAGE WINDINGS; MAGNETIC FIELD DISTRIBUTION; MAGNETIC FIELD SIMULATION; MULTI-PHYSICAL FIELDS; OIL IMMERSED TRANSFORMERS; TRANSFORMER MODELING; TURN-TO-TURN INSULATIONS; TRANSFORMER WINDINGS","ANSYS; FLUENT; FLUID-TEMPERATURE FIELD; MAGNETIC FIELD; TURN-TO-TURN INSULATION","","","INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC.","","978-172815511-1","","","ENGLISH","IEEE INT.

HOWEVER, THE EVALUATION PARAMETERS REQUIRED IN THE EXISTING EVOLUTION PREDICTION METHODS ARE NOT ONLY DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN, BUT ALSO RESULT IN LARGE DEVIATIONS IN THE ESTIMATED TIME DUE TO THE IMPROPER FUSION BETWEEN THE PARAMETERS. THEREFORE, IN THIS PAPER, BASED ON THE IMPROVED FULL-STATE INTEGRATION METHOD MODEL, THE MULTI-SPECTRAL IMAGE FUSION OF THE POWER EQUIPMENT AND THE PREDICTION OF THE EVOLUTION OF FAULT GRADUAL CHANGES EFFECTED BY MULTI-PARAMETERS ARE STUDIED. THE TEMPERATURE PARAMETERS OF KEY COMPONENTS OF THE DEVICES ARE EXTRACTED FROM THE UNSTRUCTURED IMAGE DATA BY MATCHING THE INFRARED DETECTION IMAGE WITH THE INFRARED STANDARD LIBRARY AND BY THE INFRARED-VISIBLE LIGHT IMAGE FUSION. A CLUSTERING ALGORITHM COMBINED WITH THE OPERATING PARAMETERS IS USED TO DIAGNOSE FAULTS.

ACCORDINGLY, THIS PAPER PRESENTS A HYBRID METHOD FOR DETECTION AND CLASSIFICATION OF INCIPIENT FAULTS IN TPT USING DISSOLVED GAS ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES (DGAT) INFORMATION AND RULE-BASED MACHINE LEARNING METHOD. IN THE DEVELOPED METHOD, THE MOST INFORMATIVE AND IMPORTANT ITEMS OF DGAT DATA OUT OF 14 ITEMS SELECTED BY ASSOCIATION RULES MINING TECHNIQUE (ARMT) ARE EMPLOYED AS THE INPUT OF ADAPTIVE NEURO-FUZZY INFERENCE SYSTEM (ANFIS). THE ARMT IS IMPLEMENTED TO SELECT THE ITEMS, WHICH HAVE MAXIMUM INFORMATION AND CAN TRAIN THE ANFIS MORE ACCURATELY. FURTHERMORE, IN ORDER TO ENHANCE THE ACCURACY OF ANFIS AND IMPROVE ITS ROBUSTNESS IN DIFFERENT IMPLEMENTATIONS, BLACK WIDOW OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM IS APPLIED FOR ANFIS TRAINING. IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF DEVELOPED METHOD ON REAL ISSUES, TWO INDUSTRIAL DATA COLLECTIONS OBTAINED FROM IRAN-TRANSFO COMPANY CHEMICAL LABORATORY AND DAMAVAND POWER SUBSTATIONS ARE USED.

THEN, ACCORDING TO THE LOSS RELATION BETWEEN ON-LOAD CAPACITY REGULATING DISTRIBUTION TRANSFORMERS AND CONVENTIONAL DISTRIBUTION TRANSFORMERS, THREE CHARACTERISTIC INDEXES OF ANNUAL CONTINUOUS APPARENT POWER CURVE AND REPLACEMENT CRITERIA FOR ON-LOAD CAPACITY REGULATING DISTRIBUTION TRANSFORMERS WERE PUT FORWARD IN THIS PAPER, AND A SET OF DISTRIBUTION TRANSFORMER REPLACEABLE POINTS WAS OBTAINED.

DEVELOPMENT OF NANOFLUIDS BASED ON ESTER OIL IS CONSIDERED AS THE FUTURE OF INSULATING FLUIDS WHICH HOLD GREAT POTENTIAL TO ENHANCE THE DESIGN ASPECT OF HIGH VOLTAGE APPARATUS. IN THE CURRENT STUDY EFFECT OF SIO2 ON DIELECTRIC PROPERTIES OF NATURAL ESTER OIL HAS BEEN STUDIED. BASED ON VARIOUS ELECTRICAL ANALYSIS, AN ATTEMPT HAS BEEN MADE TO IDENTIFY THE OPTIMUM CONCENTRATION OF NANOPARTICLES IN TERMS OF VOLUME CONCENTRATION. IN ORDER TO ENHANCE DISPERSION AND IMPROVE SURFACE PROPERTIES, CTAB HAS BEEN CHOSEN AS A SURFACTANT AND ITS OPTIMUM CONCENTRATION WITH RESPECT TO NANOFLUID HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. CORONA INCEPTION VOLTAGE (CIV) RESULTS INDICATE THAT BEYOND A CERTAIN VALUE, ADDITION OF NANOPARTICLES CAN DEGRADE THE DIELECTRIC PROPERTIES OF OIL. THESE RESULTS ARE FURTHER CONFIRMED BY TESTING THE LEVITATION VOLTAGE OF THE PARTICLE IN THE ELECTRODE GAP. IT IS REALIZED THAT INCIPIENT DISCHARGES DUE TO CORONA/PARTICLE MOVEMENT CAN RADIATE ELECTRO-MAGNETIC WAVES WITH ITS FREQUENCY LYING IN ULTRA HIGH FREQUENCY (UHF) SIGNAL RANGE. IT IS OBSERVED THAT THE BANDWIDTH OF THE RADIATED SIGNAL LIES IN THE FREQUENCY RANGE OF 0.7-2 GHZ, WITH ITS DOMINANT FREQUENCY AT 0.9 GHZ. IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THE NUMBER OF DISCHARGES CAUSED DUE TO CORONA/PARTICLE MOVEMENT ARE LESS FOR THE IDENTIFIED OPTIMUM CONCENTRATION OF NANO SIO2 IN TRANSFORMER OIL.

THE OPERATING TEMPERATURE OF A TRANSFORMER DOMINANTLY GOVERNS ITS AGING RATE. IN THE PRESENT RESEARCH, A RENEWABLE COOLANT AS A VERSATILE SUBSTITUTION FOR THE PETROLEUM-BASED OILS WAS INVESTIGATED TO BE EMPLOYED IN THE COOLING OF TRANSFORMERS. THE STUDIED COOLANT IS A VEGETABLE-BASED OIL EXTRACTED FROM THE WASTE COOKING OILS. A NUMERICAL MODEL WAS DEVELOPED TO FOLLOW THE INSTANTANEOUS CHANGES IN THE LOAD PROFILE AND AMBIENT TEMPERATURE AND PREDICT THE INSTANTANEOUS HOTSPOT TEMPERATURE VALUES IN THE TRANSFORMER UNDER DYNAMIC LOAD. THEN, THIS THERMAL MODEL WAS USED TO EXPLORE THE CAPABILITY OF THE STUDIED VEGETABLE OIL IN THE COOLING OF TRANSFORMERS COMPARED WITH CONVENTIONAL TRANSFORMER OIL. THE REALISTIC AMBIENT TEMPERATURE AND LOADING PROFILE, AS WELL AS THERMAL PROPERTIES OF OILS AND CHARACTERISTICS OF A TRANSFORMER, WERE APPLIED AS THE MODEL'S INPUTS. THE AGING RATE OF THE TRANSFORMER IN THE PRESENCE OF VEGETABLE OIL WAS ALSO COMPARED WITH THE CONVENTIONAL TRANSFORMER OIL. THE RESULTS INDICATE A BETTER COOLING PERFORMANCE FOR THE VEGETABLEBASED OIL, WHERE A HOTSPOT TEMPERATURE REDUCTION OF 3 °C WAS OBSERVED IN COMPARISON TO THE PETROLEUM-BASED OIL. ALSO, THE MODEL PREDICTS A SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER LIFE FOR THE INSULATING SYSTEM OF THE TRANSFORMER WHEN THE PROPOSED VEGETABLE-BASED OIL IS EMPLOYED. THE RESULTS OF THIS RESEARCH SUGGEST A SUSTAINABLE WAY OF REUSING THE WASTE OF A RENEWABLE RESOURCE AS AN ALTERNATIVE INSULATING LIQUID FOR THE COOLING OF HIGH HEAT FLUX ELECTRIC/ELECTRONIC DEVICES.

THE OSI VOLTAGE WITHSTAND TEST IS CARRIED OUT ON A 110 KV THREE-PHASE DOUBLE-WINDING TRANSFORMER ON SITE. FURTHERMORE, TRANSFER FUNCTION (TF) ANALYSIS IS USED FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF TRANSFORMER INSULATION WITH HIGH SENSITIVITY DURING THE OSI TEST. THE FAULT WINDING IS DISTINGUISHED BY COMPARING THE CHANGE IN THE VOLTAGE TF AND CURRENT TF AT DIFFERENT VOLTAGE LEVELS.

IN ADDITION, SUCH PROPOSALS DO NOT NECESSARILY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE COSTS THAT REPRESENT THE SYSTEM, EITHER BY UNDER-SIZING OR OVER-SIZING THE RESERVE. ACCORDING TO THE ABOVE, IT IS NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH A METHODOLOGY TO BALANCE THE COST THAT WOULD REPRESENT TO MAKE INVESTMENTS FOR THE ACQUISITION OF THE RESERVE TRANSFORMERS, AND THE BENEFITS THAT WOULD PROVIDE THE RELIABILITY OF THE SYSTEM AGAINST SUCH PURCHASES. CONSEQUENTLY, A METHODOLOGY IS PROPOSED TO DETERMINE THE RESERVE OF POWER TRANSFORMERS, CONSIDERING RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, THIS PROPOSAL COULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PLANNING OF THE EXPANSION OF THE SUB TRANSMISSION IN PERU.  © 2022 IEEE.","ELECTRIC POWER TRANSMISSION; OUTAGES; POISSON DISTRIBUTION; POWER TRANSFORMERS; RISK ASSESSMENT; ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION; FAILURE RATE; KEY ISSUES; PLANNING PROCESS; PROBABILITY: DISTRIBUTIONS; RELIABILITY AND SAFETIES; RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES; RISKS ASSESSMENTS; SPARE TRANSFORMER; TRANSMISSION SYSTEMS; FAILURE RATE","ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION; FAILURE RATE; PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION; RELIABILITY; SPARE TRANSFORMER","","","INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC.","","978-166549933-0","","","ENGLISH","ASIA CONF.

TO ENHANCE THE APPLICABILITY OF STSM, SINGLE REGULATION AND JOINT REGULATION METHODS FOR THE CHARGING PRICE STRATEGY OF CHARGING STATIONS ARE PUT UP, AND THE MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF JOINT REGULATION IS FOCUSED ON. FIRST OF ALL, A JOINT REGULATION MECHANISM IS ESTABLISHED, IN WHICH EVS ARE GUIDED TO CHARGE OFF-PEAK AND OFF-STATION THROUGH THE JOINT REGULATION. SECONDLY, INTEGRATING CHARGING FEES, QUEUING COSTS, AND TRANSFER COSTS, THE EQUIVALENT CHARGING PRICES FOR EV USERS ARE PUT FORWARD. BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE OF THE EQUIVALENT CHARGING PRICES, TRANSFER PROBABILITY MODEL FOR EVS’ CHARGING PERIODS AND CHARGING STATIONS IS PROPOSED.

AS A RESULT, EVS ARE RAPIDLY INCREASING IN POPULARITY, ELECTRIFYING THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. THIS POSES A SERIOUS PROBLEM FOR THE GRID AS EXISTING DISTRIBUTION GRIDS WERE MAINLY SIZED IN THE PRE-EV ERA. IN THIS PAPER, A METHOD IS PROPOSED TO DETERMINE THE CHARGING DEMAND OF FUTURE EV FLEETS IN AN OFFICE AREA AND DETERMINE ITS FLEXIBILITY POTENTIAL. OFFICE CHARGING IS STUDIED AS IT DIFFERS FROM RESIDENTIAL CHARGING AND A LIMITED NUMBER OF STUDIES FOCUSED SOLELY ON OFFICE CHARGING. THE STUDY IS AN EMPIRICAL STUDY AND IS BASED ON ANALYSING REAL TRANSACTION DATA OF 42 EVS CHARGING FOR OVER A YEAR AT UTRECHT SCIENCE PARK, UTRECHT, THE NETHERLANDS, THE CONSIDERED CASE STUDY. THE TRANSACTION DATA ALLOWS FOR AN EXAMINATION OF THE IMPACTS OF FUTURE EV CHARGING DEMAND IN AN OFFICE AREA. THE RESULTS BASED ON A FUTURE SCENARIO STUDY SHOW THAT IN 2050, 4 OUT OF 7 STUDIED TRANSFORMERS ARE OVERLOADED. THIS IS FOLLOWED BY AN ANALYSIS ON THE MITIGATION OF THE DETERMINED IMPACT. THIS ANALYSIS ALSO DETERMINED THE FLEXIBILITY IN EV DEMAND, AROUND 50% OF THE EV DEMAND CAN BE DELAYED FOR MORE THAN 8 H. WHEN THIS FLEXIBILITY IS USED, OVERLOADING OF 3 OUT OF 4 TRANSFORMERS COULD BE MITIGATED.

A MODEL FOR WIND SPEED AND LOAD DEMAND ESTIMATION FOR EACH HOUR OF THE DAY IS FORMULATED BY USING THE PARTITION AROUND MEDOIDS (PAM) TECHNIQUE OVER AN ANNUAL DATABASE OF LOAD DEMAND AND WIND SPEED. A MULTI-OBJECTIVE MIXED-INTEGER NON-LINEAR PROGRAMMING (MINLP) APPROACH FOR OPTIMALLY LOCATING AND SIZING THE SST INSTALLATIONS IN THE RADIAL DISTRIBUTION NETWORK (RDN) IS PRESENTED TO ADDRESS THE DUAL OBJECTIVES OF VOLTAGE PROFILE IMPROVEMENT (VPI) AND ENERGY LOSS REDUCTION (ELR).

IN THIS REGARD, THE ROLE OF UNCONVENTIONAL SOURCES OF ELECTRICITY, SUCH AS SOLAR PANELS AND WIND FARMS, HAS INCREASED. THE GROWING ROLE OF DIRECT CURRENT OCCURS DUE TO THE TRANSITION OF THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY FROM AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE TO AN ELECTRIC MOTOR, AS WELL AS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE SERVICE LIFE AND CAPACITY OF BATTERIES. HOWEVER, EXISTING GRIDS DO NOT INTEGRATE WELL WITH RECEIVERS AND SOURCES USING DC FOR THE OPERATION, WHICH LEADS TO A DECREASE IN THE QUALITY, RELIABILITY OF POWER SUPPLY AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS. THE WAY OUT OF THIS SITUATION IS THE TRANSITION FROM TRADITIONAL TO SMART GRIDS, WHICH NEED TO SEARCH FOR NEW METHODS, DEVICES AND SOLUTIONS THAT MEET THE FOLLOWING RULES: COORDINATED OPERATION BETWEEN DC AND AC CIRCUITS WITH THE ABILITY TO INTEGRATE BATTERIES AND CHARGING STATIONS; MAINTAINING THE QUALITY OF ELECTRICITY IN VARIOUS OPERATING MODES, INCLUDING OFF NOMINAL ONES; COLLECTION, CONVERSION INTO DIGITAL FORM AND TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE STATE AND OPERATING MODE OF THE SUBSTATION TECHNOLOGICAL EQUIPMENT AND SYSTEMS IN REAL TIME OPERATION; FLEXIBILITY AND RELIABILITY IN THE DISTRIBUTION AND GENERATION OF ELECTRICITY; HIGH ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY; SELF-DIAGNOSTIC FUNCTIONS TO ENSURE THE DETECTION OF EQUIPMENT AND SYSTEMS FAILURE WITH AN ACCURACY OF A SINGLE MODULE (BLOCK). AT THE SAME TIME, A CLASSICAL TRANSFORMER CANNOT COPE WITH THE ASSIGNED TASKS; ITS DISADVANTAGES ARE GIVEN IN THIS ARTICLE. ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS TO THIS PROBLEM IS THE USE OF SOLID-STATE TRANSFORMERS-SEMICONDUCTOR AC POWER CONVERTERS. THE PAPER PRESENTS TOPOLOGIES AND AREAS OF APPLICATION OF CLASSICAL AC AND DC NETWORKS, THEIR DISADVANTAGES. IT IS SHOWN THAT WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF DIRECT CURRENT SOURCES AND CONSUMERS, PROBLEMS ARISE WITH THE INTEGRATION OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF CURRENT AND VOLTAGE LEVELS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NUMBER OF CONVERSION STEPS AND THE QUALITY OF ELECTRICITY. A BLOCK DIAGRAM OF SMART POWER SUPPLY NETWORKS BASED ON A SOLID-STATE TRANSFORMER IS GIVEN WITH A DESCRIPTION OF WHAT INCREASES THE OVERALL EFFICIENCY OF THE NETWORK, THE QUALITY AND FLEXIBILITY IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF ELECTRICITY WHILE REDUCING THE NUMBER OF CONVERSION STEPS. THE TOPOLOGIES OF SINGLE-STAGE, TWO-STAGE AND THREE-STAGE SOLID-STATE TRANSFORMERS ARE GIVEN AND THE AREAS OF THEIR APPLICATION IN DIFFERENT SYSTEMS ARE SHOWN. IT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED THAT FOR SMART POWER SUPPLY NETWORKS, THE MOST SUITABLE IS A THREE-STAGE TOPOLOGY OF A SOLID-STATE TRANSFORMER, WHICH MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO IMPLEMENT GALVANIC ISOLATION WITH TWO DC-LINKS, WHICH WILL PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY IN SWITCHING POWER SUPPLY FROM DC TO AC AND VICE VERSA, AS WELL AS INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE ENTIRE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE.MATHEMATICAL MODELING OF THE OPERATION OF A THREE-STAGE THREE-PHASE SOLID-STATE TRANSFORMER FOR A SYMMETRICAL THREE-PHASE ACTIVE-INDUCTIVE LOAD IS PRESENTED. THE SYSTEM HAS OUTPUT CURRENT AND VOLTAGE FEEDBACK AND AUTOMATIC VOLTAGE REGULATION ON THE SECOND DC-LINK. THE TRACKING LOOP IS IMPLEMENTED BY CHANGING THE ANGLE OF BLOCK MODULATION IN THE CONTROLLED INVERTER AND RECTIFIER, WHICH ARE PART OF THE DUAL ACTIVE BRIDGE OF A THREE-STAGE SOLID-STATE TRANSFORMER. THE CONTROLLER IS A PROPORTIONAL-INTEGRAL CONTROLLER. THE GRAPHS OF THE CURRENT AND VOLTAGE CHANGES WHEN THE LOAD IS SWITCHED ON AND OFF ARE GIVEN. IT IS SHOWN THAT THE VOLTAGE DROP IS INSIGNIFICANT AND IS ALMOST COMPLETELY COMPENSATED BY THE STORED REACTIVE ENERGY IN THE REACTIVE ELEMENTS OF A SOLID-STATE TRANSFORMER.THE APPLICATIONS OF SOLID-STATE TRANSFORMERS, THEIR ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES, AS WELL AS WAYS TO ELIMINATE THESE DISADVANTAGES ARE DESCRIBED IN THE ARTICLE.

THE INRUSH CURRENT NOT ONLY AFFECTS THE PERFORMANCE OF THE TRANSFORMER WINDINGS, BUT ALSO AFFECTS THE LIFETIME OF THE TRANSFORMER. MANY FACTORS AFFECT THE INRUSH CURRENT, THE MOST INFLUENTIAL ONES AMONG WHICH ARE THE CLOSING PHASE ANGLE AND THE RESIDUAL FLUX. IN THIS PAPER, A DRY-TYPE TRANSFORMER SIMULATION MODEL IS BUILT TO ANALYZE THE INFLUENCE OF THE INRUSH CURRENT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF TRANSFORMER WINDINGS DURING NO-LOAD RECLOSING CONDITIONS. FIRSTLY, THE INRUSH CURRENT WAS GENERATED IN THE TRANSFORMER WINDINGS DURING THE NO-LOAD RECLOSING OPERATION UNDER DIFFERENT RESIDUAL FLUXES. SECONDLY, THE FIELD-CIRCUIT COUPLING 3D FINITE ELEMENT METHOD IS USED TO ANALYZE THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE AT DIFFERENT LOCATIONS OF THE TRANSFORMER WINDINGS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF DIFFERENT INRUSH CURRENTS. THE RESULTS OF WINDING STRUCTURAL PARAMETER VARIATIONS ARE OBTAINED THROUGH ELECTROMAGNETIC-STRUCTURAL COUPLING SIMULATION, AND THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCES ARE USED AS THE INPUT PARAMETER FOR THE STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS. FINALLY, THE RESIDUAL FLUX IS GENERATED BY CONTROLLING THE OPENING AND CLOSING ANGLE OF THE TRANSFORMER THROUGH THE PHASE-CONTROLLED SWITCH, AND THE WINDING ELECTROMECHANICAL CHARACTERISTICS ARE TESTED UNDER DIFFERENT RESIDUAL FLUXES. FINALLY, COMPARISONS OF THE TEST AND SIMULATION RESULTS ARE DRAWN TO VERIFY THE IMPACT OF THE CLOSING ANGLE AND RESIDUAL FLUX ON INRUSH CURRENT AND THE WINDING DEFORMATION DURING THE NO-LOAD RECLOSING CONDITIONS. © 2021 BY THE AUTHORS.

THIS LEADS TO ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS, BUT THESE PEVS REPRESENT NEW CHALLENGES FACING THE POWER GRID. THEREFORE, THE POWER GRID MUST BE PREPARED FOR THESE CHALLENGES. THIS PAPER PROVIDES A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY OF PEVS CHARGING IMPACT ON THE LOW VOLTAGE DISTRIBUTION GRID. FOR THIS PURPOSE, A TYPICAL HUNGARIAN LOW VOLTAGE GRID WAS MODELED IN DIGSILENT POWER FACTORY. TWO CHARGING SCENARIOS HAVE BEEN STUDIED, UNCOORDINATED CHARGING AND DELAYED CHARGING. THREE PENETRATION LEVELS OF PEVS ARE CONSIDERED IN THIS PAPER AS FOLLOWS, 20%, 40%, AND 60% TIME SWEEP ANALYSIS IS USED TO INVESTIGATE TRANSFORMER LOADING, FEEDERS LOADING, VOLTAGE DEVIATION AND SYSTEM TOTAL LOSSES. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT AT 60% PENETRATION LEVEL WITH UNCOORDINATED CHARGING, BOTH THE DISTRIBUTION TRANSFORMER AND FEEDERS THERMAL LOADING VIOLATION IS EXPERIENCED.

IT CONTRIBUTES TO INTENSIFY THE FLATTENING EFFECTS ON THE EXCHANGING POWER PATTERN WITH A CONSTRAINT OF A FAIR PROFIT REDUCTION AMONG HOUSEHOLDS. THE PROPOSED METHOD FIRST USES A NORMAL MIXED-INTEGER LINEAR PROGRAMMING APPROACH TO FIND OUT THE HIGHEST PROFIT A HOUSEHOLD CAN GET UNDER A CONDITION OF A GENEROUS POWER LIMITATION. IT IS HIGHLY POSSIBLE THAT THE RESULTED POWER AGGREGATED FROM NUMEROUS HOMES MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT POWER SYSTEM OPERATION SUCH AS VIOLATING VOLTAGE LIMITS AND OVERLOADING TRANSFORMERS. BASED ON THAT HIGHEST PROFIT, THE UTILITY PROPOSES THE SAME PERCENTAGE NUMBER OF PROFIT REDUCTION FOR ALL HOUSEHOLDS. THEN, EACH HEMS PERFORMS AN INTENSIVE MIXED-INTEGER QUADRATIC PROGRAMMING OPTIMIZATION TO FLATTEN THE SELLING AND BUYING PROFILES WHILST CONSTRAINING THE HOME PROFIT REDUCTION TO THE PERCENTAGE SET BY THE UTILITY. A SIMULATION SHOWS THAT THE PEAK POWER DEMAND AT THE SUBSTATION TRANSFORMER WOULD REDUCE ABOUT 44% IF EACH HOUSEHOLD SUFFERED A REDUCTION OF JUST 10% OF THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE HOME PROFIT. SINCE THE FLATTENING EFFECTS ARE IMPROVED IF INCREASING THE HOME PROFIT REDUCTION, OUR METHOD IS A BASIS FOR THE UTILITY TO DETERMINE A COMPENSATION OR ALTERNATIVE INCENTIVES TO SHAVE THE PEAK-LOAD AND FLATTEN THE DEMAND CURVE. © 2019 ELSEVIER LTD","AUTOMATION; ENERGY MANAGEMENT; INTEGER PROGRAMMING; PROFITABILITY; QUADRATIC PROGRAMMING; TRANSFORMER SUBSTATIONS; HOME ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS; PEAK LOAD; ROOFTOP SOLAR; SMART HOMES; SMART HOUSEHOLD; ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS","HOME ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM; PEAK-LOAD SHAVING; ROOFTOP SOLAR; SMART HOME; SMART HOUSEHOLD","H.

COMMUNITY ENERGY STORAGE (CES) IS ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS TO OFFER FLEXIBILITY. IN THIS PAPER TWO SCENARIOS OF CES OWNERSHIP ARE PROPOSED. FIRSTLY, AN ENERGY ARBITRAGE (EA) SCENARIO IS STUDIED WHERE AN AGGREGATOR AIMS TO MINIMIZE COSTS AND CO2-EMISSIONS OF AN ENERGY PORTFOLIO. SECONDLY, AN ENERGY ARBITRAGE - PEAK SHAVING (EA-PS) SCENARIO IS ASSESSED, WHICH IS BASED ON A SHARED OWNERSHIP BETWEEN A DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM OPERATOR (DSO) AND AN AGGREGATOR. A MULTI-OBJECTIVE MIXED INTEGER LINEAR PROGRAMMING (MILP) OPTIMIZATION MODEL IS DEVELOPED TO MINIMIZE THE OPERATION COSTS AND CO2-EMISSIONS OF A COMMUNITY SITUATED IN CERNIER (SWITZERLAND), USING DIFFERENT BATTERY TECHNOLOGIES IN THE CES SYSTEM. THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE A PROFITABLE SYSTEM DESIGN FOR ALL LITHIUM-ION-BATTERIES (LIBS) AND THE VANADIUM REDOX FLOW BATTERY (VRFB), FOR BOTH THE EA AND EA-PS SCENARIOS. THE ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE OF THE EA-PS SCENARIO IS SLIGHTLY WORSE COMPARED TO THE EA SCENARIO, DUE TO POWER BOUNDARIES ON GRID ABSORPTION AND INJECTION TO ACHIEVE PEAK SHAVING. OVERALL, THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE EA AND EA-PS SCENARIOS, IN ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE, ARE SMALL. THEREFORE, THE EA-PS IS RECOMMENDED TO PREVENT PROBLEMATIC LOADS ON THE DISTRIBUTION TRANSFORMER. IN ADDITION, THE PARETO FRONTIERS DEMONSTRATE THAT LIBS PERFORM BEST ON BOTH ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE, WITH THE BEST ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE FOR THE LITHIUM-NICKEL-MANGANESE-COBALT (NMC-C) BATTERY. © 2019 THE AUTHOR(S)","SWITZERLAND; CARBON DIOXIDE; DIGITAL INSTRUMENTS; ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEM ECONOMICS; ELECTRIC TRANSFORMERS; ENERGY STORAGE; ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT; FINANCIAL MARKETS; FLOW BATTERIES; INTEGER PROGRAMMING; LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES; RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES; BATTERY TECHNOLOGY; COMMUNITY ENERGY; COMMUNITY ENERGY STORAGES (CES); ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE; ENERGY ARBITRAGES; MIXED-INTEGER LINEAR PROGRAMMING; PEAK SHAVING; VANADIUM REDOX FLOW BATTERIES; ALTERNATIVE ENERGY; CARBON EMISSION; ECONOMIC CONDITIONS; ENERGY RESOURCE; ENERGY STORAGE; EQUIPMENT; OPTIMIZATION; TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE; MULTIOBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION","BATTERY TECHNOLOGIES; COMMUNITY ENERGY STORAGE; ENERGY ARBITRAGE; MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION; PEAK SHAVING","T.

A QUARTER OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WHICH ARE GENERATED IN THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) IS DUE TO TRANSPORTATION. ONE OF THE MAIN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IS CO2 GAS AND ABOUT 15% OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS, WHICH IS CO2, ARE PRODUCED THROUGH LIGHT VEHICLES SUCH AS PICKUPS AND CARS. ON THE OTHER HAND, DUE TO INCREASED UTILIZATION OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES, THE POWER GRID STRUCTURE NEEDS TO BE DEVELOPED AND IMPROVED. BECAUSE OF THE VEHICLES EFFECT ON THE LOW VOLTAGE NETWORK, DISTRIBUTION SERVICE OPERATORS (DSOS) WILL PREPARE THE FAILED FOR THE MENTIONED EFFECTS. IN THIS PAPER, THE IMPACT OF CHARGING ELECTRIC VEHICLES ON LOW VOLTAGE NETWORKS STRUCTURE AND TECHNOLOGY OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED. A NOVEL UPPER AND LOWER BASED VOLTAGE CONTROLLER IS INTRODUCED AS DISTRIBUTED AGENT-BASED MODEL TO CONTROL THE VOLTAGE STABILITY IN TEST SMART GRID. IN THE PROPOSED METHOD, BASED ON RULE DEFINING FOR DISTRIBUTED AGENT, THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE (EV) CHARGING WILL COOPERATE WITH SMART GRID AND ITS CHARGING TIME WILL BE MOVED FROM PEAK TIME TO OTHER TIMES. BY THIS ACTION OF AGENTS, THE SMART GRID LOAD AND THE STABILITY OF VOLTAGE CAN BE MANAGED BESIDE THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS CONSIDERATION. IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PROPOSED METHOD AND THE EFFECT OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES, THIS METHOD HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED ON A LOW VOLTAGE NETWORK OF A RESTRICTED DISTRICT OF BUDAPEST BASED ON DIGSILENT. ACCORDING TO OBTAINED RESULTS, IT COULD BE CONSIDERED THAT THE MAXIMUM TRANSFORMER LOADING WITH EV IS ABOUT 41% AND 36.6% WITHOUT EV. FURTHERMORE, TRANSFORMER LOADING IS ABOUT 14.761% FOR COMMON ARRIVAL SIMULATIONS TO 10.072% WITHOUT EVS. SO, THE PROPOSED MODEL CAN BE EFFECTIVE IN LOW VOLTAGE GRIDS OF TRANSMISSION BY PREVENTING THE POLLUTION.

THREE TYPES OF ACTORS ARE INCLUDED IN THE SYSTEM: DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM OPERATORS (DSOS), FLEET OPERATORS (FOS), AND EV OWNERS. IN CONTRAST TO A TYPICAL HIERARCHICAL CONTROL SYSTEM WHERE THE UPPER LEVEL CONTROLLER DIRECTLY CONTROLS THE LOWER LEVEL SUBORDINATED NODES, THIS STUDY AIMS TO INTEGRATE TWO COMMON INDIRECT CONTROL METHODS: MARKET-BASED CONTROL AND PRICE-BASED CONTROL INTO THE HIERARCHICAL EVS' MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. SPECIFICALLY, ON THE LOWER LEVEL OF THE HIERARCHY, THE FOS COORDINATE THE CHARGING BEHAVIORS OF THEIR EV USERS USING A PRICE-BASED CONTROL METHOD. A PARAMETRIC UTILITY MODEL IS USED ON THE LOWER LEVEL TO CHARACTERIZE PRICE ELASTICITY OF EVS AND THUS USED BY THE FO TO COORDINATE THE INDIVIDUAL EV CHARGING. ON THE UPPER LEVEL OF THE HIERARCHY, THE DSO USES THE MARKET-BASED CONTROL STRATEGY TO COORDINATE THE LIMITED POWER CAPACITY OF POWER TRANSFORMER WITH FOS.

THIS APPROACH, HOWEVER, IS NOT VALID ANYMORE DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF DISTRIBUTED GENERATION, WHICH IS MAINLY BASED ON RENEWABLE ENERGIES, AND THE INCREASED NUMBER OF PLUG-IN ELECTRIC VEHICLES THAT ARE CONNECTED AT THIS VOLTAGE LEVEL FOR DOMESTIC USE. IN THIS PAPER THE ONGOING TRANSITION THAT DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS FACE IS ADDRESSED. WHEREAS DISTRIBUTED RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES INCREASE NODAL VOLTAGES, ELECTRIC VEHICLES RESULT IN DEMAND SURGES HIGHER THAN THE LOAD PREDICTIONS CONSIDERED WHEN PLANNING THESE NETWORKS, LEADING TO CONGESTION IN DISTRIBUTION LINES AND TRANSFORMERS. ADDITIONALLY, CENTRALIZED CONTROL TECHNIQUES ARE ANALYZED TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF DISTRIBUTED GENERATION AND ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND INCREASE THEIR EFFECTIVE INTEGRATION. A CLASSIFICATION OF THE DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES APPLIED TO THE PROBLEMS OF VOLTAGE CONTROL AND CONGESTION MANAGEMENT IS PRESENTED. © 2021 BY THE AUTHORS.
