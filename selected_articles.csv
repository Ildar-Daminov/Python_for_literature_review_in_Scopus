The transformer's role has not changed over the last decades. With simple construction and at the same time mechanically robust, they offer long term service that on average can reach half a century. Today, with the ongoing trend to supply a growing number of non-linear loads along with the notion of distributed generation (DG), a new challenge has arisen in terms of transformer sustainability, with one of the possible consequences being accelerated ageing. In this paper we carefully review the existing studies in the literature of the effect of loads and other key factors on oil-transformer ageing. The state-of-the-art is reviewed, each factor is analysed in detail, and in the end a smart transformer protection method is sought in order to monitor and protect it from upcoming challenges. © 2015 by the authors.",Electric power distribution; Loading; Oil filled transformers; Sustainable development; Accelerated ageing; Energy; Long term service; Mechanically robust; Nonlinear load; Oil transformers; State of the art; Transformer; Transformer protection,Distribution network; Energy; Load; Sustainability; Transformer,"J.P.S.

This paper proposes a demand response optimization model based on transformer hottest-spot temperature. The optimization model quantifies the improvement of transformer utilization through DR. The proposed model is applied to a typical Finnish residential primary and secondary distribution transformers for case studies of load with and without DR. The results show that the loading on the transformers can be significantly increased without sacrificing the life of transformers. The gain in utilization depends on the DR capability of the load. Significant monetary benefits can be achieved with the deployment of the proposed model in a real system. © 2014 IEEE.",Aging of materials; Electric transformers; Optimization; Smart power grids; Asset utilization; Demand response; Loss of life; Power distributions; Smart grid; Transformer; Loading,Aging; Asset utilization; Demand response; Loss of life; Power distribution; Smart grid; Transformer,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,08858977,,ITPDE,,English,IEEE Trans Power Delivery,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027918526

Studies have shown that the DTR system can provide ratings that are higher than the traditional static thermal rating (STR) 80% to 90% of the time; 50% of the time, DTR is 15% to 30% higher than STR. Hence, the benefits and applications of the DTR system have been widely investigated and reported in various review papers. However, available reviews of the DTR system focused on transmission lines and networks only, ignoring the thermal limits of the transformer and distribution cable, which could form a thermal bottleneck. Moreover, these review articles cover only a few research themes, and many important research topics are left undiscussed. Therefore, these reviews cannot provide sufficiently diverse research on the DTR system. These drawbacks are addressed in this review article, which covers 176 notable research articles related to the DTR system obtained from three major databases, namely, IEEE, Elsevier, and Wiley. The collected articles are categorized based on their focus (e.g., distribution networks, transmission networks, and transformers) and then further classified into small groups on the basis of their research themes.

Recently, natural and synthetic ester oils have been proposed as environmentally friendly oils to substitute conventional mineral oil. This paper aims to evaluate the transformer thermal performance when using these environmentally friendly oils under different loading power factors. Three commercial types of environmentally friendly oils are considered, Midel 1204 and Midel 1215 as natural esters and Midel 7131 as a synthetic ester. Thermal-related properties of these esters are experimentally evaluated. These results include viscosity, thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, and density. The experimental data is used to find a best representative formula for the thermo physical properties of these oils as a function of operating temperature by using least square regression method. A model 3D CFD COMSOL model is built including heat transfer model and laminar flow model to calculate the rated top oil temperature (TOT) and the rated winding hottest spot temperature (HST) for these environmentally friendly oils and for mineral oil. The rated output TOT and HST from COMSOL are used as inputs for a developed MATLAB model through which TOT and HST all day long can be obtained. Using these models, the TOT and HST for transformers filled with mineral oil and environmentally friendly oils are obtained. Also, the transformer aging and loss of life are assessed with these oils for the different scenarios of the loading power factor (PF). Finally, the annual energy losses of the transformer, their cost, and their impact on greenhouses gases emissions and corresponding environmental cost are evaluated as key issues for making proper decisions toward using environmentally friendly oils. It was found that using environmentally friendly oils reduces significantly the transformer aging compared to using mineral oil for different loading PFs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",3D modeling; Computational fluid dynamics; Electric power factor; Energy dissipation; Esters; Heat transfer; Laminar flow; Least squares approximations; MATLAB; Mineral oils; Minerals; Regression analysis; Specific heat; Thermal conductivity; Environmentally friendly oils; Hotspot temperature; Hottest-spot temperatures; Least square regression method; Representative formula; Thermal Performance; Thermo-physical property; Top oil temperature; Oil filled transformers,Environmentally friendly oils; Hot spot temperature; Thermal performance; Top oil temperature; Transformer aging,"D.-E.A.

In order to accurately estimate the health index state of power transformers and predict the incipient operation failure, a dynamic fault prediction technique based on hidden Markov model (HMM) of DGA is proposed in this paper. Gaussian mixture model, as a soft clustering method, is used to extract the static features of different health states from a DGA dataset of 65 in-service power transformers with 1600 days operation. Especially, a sub-health state is introduced to enrich the health index and aging stages of power transformers. The static features between health states and concentrations of dissolved gases are built, and the effectiveness of clustering is cross validated. Furthermore, taking time sequence into consideration, transition probability of power transformer between different health states based on the HMM model is calculated and analyzed. The effectiveness of dynamic early warning and incipient fault prediction in sub-health status of in-service power transformers has been proved. Moreover, the dynamic fault prediction is able to provide decision-making basis for practical condition-based operation and maintenances. © 1986-2012 IEEE.",Decision making; Dissolution; Forecasting; Gaussian distribution; Health; Oil filled transformers; Power transformers; Trellis codes; Dissolved gases analysis; Fault prediction; Gaussian Mixture Model; Oil immersed power transformer; Operation and maintenance; Operation failure; Sub-health state; Transition probabilities; Hidden Markov models,dissolved gases analysis; fault prediction; Gaussian mixture model; hidden Markov model; Power transformers,"J.

These flexibilities allow system operators to modify a transformer loading in a smart way. Therefore, power constraints of transformers can be overcome by using the appropriate flexibility. However, transformers have a physical limit of energy transfer which cannot be overpassed. This energy limit represents the unique transformer's loading profile, ensuring the highest energy transfer under a given ambient temperature profile. The paper explains how the energy limit can be calculated. Typical characteristics of an energy limit are estimated in cold continental climate of Russia and warm temperate climate in France. Maximal, minimal and mean loadings are identified for each month. Loading durations of energy limit are determined for each cooling system. It is found that winding temperatures of transformers, operating at energy limits, remain in the vicinity of design winding temperature. Therefore, transformer operation at energy limit avoids a high temperature stress and simultaneously maximizes the energy transfer. The application of energy limits for power system problems is briefly explained along the paper. Energy limit application can reduce an energy cost, maximize a renewable generation and increase a hosting capacity of distribution network. © 2020 The Authors.

The most used oil in power transformers is mineral oil. However, dielectric oils based on natural esters possess some advantages in comparison with mineral oil such as higher biodegradability, fire safety and availability. Therefore, they might be the most ideal substitute for mineral oil. The introduction of a new material requires the evaluation of its degradation rate because this determines transformers' life span. In order to assess the performance of new insulating systems based on vegetable oils, simulations to obtain the hot-spot temperatures in power transformers using vegetable oils and controlled laboratory experiments of ageing were carried out. The reason is that hot spot temperature inside windings of the oil-immersed power transformers is one of the main manifestations of the thermal stress which leads to aging of insulation systems. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, a moisture-dependent thermal model (MDTM) for estimating the transformer hot-spot temperature is proposed. In this model, nonlinear thermal resistance is formulated by considering oil and cellulose (paper and pressboard) of the transformer. Especially, the effect of moisture concentration and temperature on the thermal resistance of cellulose is taken into account. The proposed MDTM is verified by using historical data, including moisture-in-oil measurements, temperature measurements, and loading profiles, which were collected from two in-service power transformers, that is, a vegetable oil-filled transformer and a mineral oil-filled transformer. Comparisons between the proposed MDTM and a number of existing thermal models were performed on the basis of adequacy and accuracy metrics. © 1986-2012 IEEE.",Moisture; Press Boards; Thermal Resistance; Transformers; Cellulose; Moisture; Power transformers; Temperature measurement; Thermography (temperature measurement); Historical data; Hotspot temperature; Life expectancies; Moisture concentration; Thermal modelling; Top oil temperature; transformer; Transformer hot-spot temperatures; Oil filled transformers,Hot-spot temperature; moisture; top-oil temperature; transformer,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,08858977,,ITPDE,,English,IEEE Trans Power Delivery,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84990058617

From this survey, it is found that a single intelligent approach for fault diagnosis can only reflect operation status of the transformer in one particular aspect, causing various degrees of shortcomings that cannot be resolved effectively. Combined with the current research status in this field, the problems that must be addressed in DGA-based transformer fault diagnosis are identified, and the prospects for future development trends and research directions are outlined. This contribution presents a detailed and systematic survey on various intelligent approaches to faults diagnosing and decisions making of the power transformer, in which their merits and demerits are thoroughly investigated, as well as their improvement schemes and future development trends are proposed. Moreover, this paper concludes that a variety of intelligent algorithms should be combined for mutual complementation to form a hybrid fault diagnosis network, such that avoiding these algorithms falling into a local optimum. Moreover, it is necessary to improve the detection instruments so as to acquire reasonable characteristic gas data samples.

FDD has an essential role in the reliability and safety of modern power systems; thus, it has been recently the center of attention in both industrial and academic studies. Due to unpredictable nature of fault, it should be located and isolated fast so that its impact on transformers is minimized. The main advantage of FDD is that it prevents costly repairs, costly downtimes, putting human into danger, and destruction of the equipment nearby. Thus, understanding failure modes, their cause and effects, and developing real-time automated devices for fault diagnosis with the ability to capture the early fault signs. Recently, various studies have been conducted on FDD in transformers using different views, methods, constraints, and objectives. There are good reviews in this context, but they are mainly focused on a specific area of this vast context. The purpose of this study is to classify the publications and make a systematic review of the FDD techniques and algorithms from different aspects and views from 1990 to 2020.

With thermal monitoring, dynamic overloads of transformers are allowed; however, the thermal model used to predict hot-spot must be capable of ensuring the assessment of insulation life expectancy. Hence, this paper presents an online algorithm to estimate and predict transformers' rating in order to assess the overload capability during short and long times. The overload factors are computed using estimations of top-oil temperature. The main characteristic of this proposal is that the environmental cooling conditions are considered by the fitting of the parameters of a simple equivalent thermal circuit using an extended Kalman filter during the transformer operation. To validate the implementation of the algorithm, the information provided by typical transformer rating monitoring systems is used.

Besides, the power system has thermally sensitive assets such as lines, transformers, etc. that are normally operated under highly conservative static ratings. There is a growing trend in this regard to use the actual capacity of such assets dynamically under varying operating conditions leading to a dynamic thermal rating concept which is referred as dynamic line rating (DLR) approach specifically for lines. This study provides a comprehensive overview of existing perspectives on DLR and combination with other flexibility options from an operational point of view. Apart from the existing review studies more focused on implementation category of DLR concept, the concentration on more operational stage from the power system operation point of view leads the difference of this study compared to the mentioned studies. A categorization of the DLR implementation for either being sole or combined usage as a flexibility option is further realized.

The presented winding model offers insight into the horizontal cooling channels perpendicular to the main oil-flow direction. To visualize oil flow, tracing particles were added to the cooling oil and illuminated by high-power light-emitting diodes. The particle velocities were then determined by taking photographs with a defined exposure time. The design of the sophisticated winding model is described in the contribution. In addition to the experimental results, this contribution presents a comparison with respective numerical results from 2-D and 3-D computational fluid dynamics calculations. Finally, numerical results from the winding model concerning the oil-flow distribution inside the winding at various operating conditions are presented.

The subsequent benefits include reduced service interruptions and economic losses associated with their unavailability. Conventional test methods developed for the condition assessment of power transformers have certain limitations. To overcome such problems, fiber optic-based sensors for monitoring the condition of transformers have been developed. Flawlessly built-up fiber optic-based sensors provide online and offline assessment of various parameters like temperature, moisture, partial discharges, gas analyses, vibration, winding deformation, and oil levels, which are based on different sensing principles. In this paper a variety and assessment of different fiber optic-based diagnostic techniques for monitoring power transformers are discussed. It includes significant tutorial elements as well as some analyses. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

In this paper, H is expressed as the sum of two separable components, one relating to convection in the fluid domain and the other relating to conduction in the solid domain. Dimensional analyses on fluid flow and heat transfer show that both components are functions of dimensionless winding geometry, loss distribution, Re and Pr. The relationship between H and Re and Pr for a fixed winding geometry with uniform loss distribution is obtained by conducting computational fluid dynamics (CFD) parametric sweeps and multilayer least-square-based correlation. The correlation obtained is verified by the consistency between H from new CFD simulations and those from the correlation. For nonuniform loss distribution, when the hotspot is at the location of the highest power loss, H is in a linear relationship with Q and this linear relationship is coupled with a nonlinear relationship between H and Re and Pr. © 1986-2012 IEEE.",Computational geometry; Electric windings; Flow of fluids; Fluids; Heat transfer; Temperature distribution; Temperature measurement; Temperature sensors; Transformer windings; Winding; Cooling mode; Dimensional analysis; Hot spot; Oils; transformer; Computational fluid dynamics,CFD; dimensional analysis; disc winding; fluid flow; heat transfer; hot-spot factor; OD cooling mode; transformer,"Z.

This inadequacy may result in upgrading existing transformers of in disconnecting the entire load during demand peaks, and into wasting a portion of the total renewable energy produced during favorable weather conditions. Increasing the capacity of electrical distribution network components is therefore mandatory in order to avoid these negative circumstances; however replacing lines and transformers is costly, and often the benefits are not worth the investments. Fortunately, the capacity of distribution networks can be unlocked by managing the electrical components by their dynamic ratings, allowing operating them even beyond their rated ampacity for a limited interval of time. This paper proposes a new risk-based procedure to manage distribution transformers by their dynamic rating. Probabilistic forecasts of loads and ambient temperatures are the inputs of the procedure, which are obtained in this paper from quantile regression forests. The procedure quantifies, in a probabilistic framework, the insulation thermal ageing due to the transformer (over)load in terms of the cost sustained for rewinding the transformer. The corresponding estimated risk is made available to the distribution system operator, who may therefore take a decision comparing it to an arbitrary level of risk coverage, favoring either the power delivery to customers or the reduction of the transformer ageing rate; this level is formulated in this paper having an intuitive physical meaning, thus enabling its setting also by non-expert operators. Comprehensive numerical experiments based on actual data are presented under different configurations and scenarios, in order to validate the proposal from an energetic and economic point of view. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Electric network parameters; Electric power transmission; Electric transformers; Energy resources; Forecasting; Investments; Risk management; Risk perception; Thermal aging; Thermal insulation; Distributed Energy Resources; Distribution transformer; Electrical distribution networks; Load forecasting; Probabilistic forecasting; Probabilistic framework; Risk-based managements; Transformer ratings; Probability distributions,Dynamic transformer rating; Load forecasting; Probabilistic forecasting; Risk-based management,"P.

These problems can be partially overcome through the smart operation of power system components. In particular, under the new smart grid paradigm, lines and transformers could be loaded beyond their nameplate rating in favorable thermal conditions, without loss of rated life or breakdown. This paper deals with the loading of oil-immersed distribution transformers, and it proposes a probabilistic approach based on the monitoring of electrical and environmental conditions. The approach consists in forecasting the predictive distribution of the transformer dynamic rating, and then in forecasting the transformer allowable current. The probabilistic approach takes into account the unavoidable uncertainties involved in the thermal modeling of the transformer; indeed, it selects the allowable current through an index that takes into account both the probability of the allowable current to be higher than the predicted dynamic rating and the corresponding expected load curtailment. Numerical applications are performed on real data to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed procedure. © 1986-2012 IEEE.",Electric power systems; Electric transformers; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Rating; Uncertainty analysis; Distribution transformer; Dynamic ratings; Electrical distribution system; Electrical energy consumption; Environmental conditions; Oil immersed transformers; Probabilistic forecasting; Risk-based; Probability distributions,Distribution transformers; Dynamic rating; Probabilistic forecasting; Risk-based index,"P.

This paper presents a novel demand response (DR) based optimization model to limit load on healthy transformers during contingencies. The model selects combination of the best remedial actions among DR, load curtailment (LC) and transferring load to a neighboring substation. IEEE standard thermal and aging models are used for transformer loss-of-life (LOL) calculation. For a realistic study, the proposed model is applied to a Finnish residential two-transformer primary substation for case studies of load with and without DR. The load profile and flexibility of the demand are estimated by hourly metered consumption and survey data. Simulations are performed for two situations depending upon availability of connection with a neighboring substation. The results show that the LOL of transformers can be reduced by employing DR following contingency events and the capacity utilization can be increased correspondingly. © 2014 IEEE.",Aging of materials; Optimization; Power transformers; Smart power grids; Asset utilization; Capacity utilization; contingency; Demand response; Efficient capacities; Optimization modeling; Smart grid; Transformer loss of lives; Electric transformer loads,Aging; asset utilization; contingency; demand response; power transformer; smart grid,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,08858950,,ITPSE,,English,IEEE Trans Power Syst,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027937301

This can be more economically advantageous than the extension of the network by installing a new transformer. During the overloading periods, the cooling system of a power transformer plays a decisive role to transfer the heat generated in the windings to the surrounding ambient. The faulty operation of the cooling system should be detected by an online monitoring system before the transformer is overloaded. In this paper, an online algorithm is presented for malfunction detection of the cooling system based on the calculation of the standardized error in the calculated top-oil temperatures. Moreover, for calculation of the top-oil temperature, a new thermal model is proposed which uses a few design-dependent variables and considers different heat-transfer modes inside a transformer. For validation of the algorithm, the measured data during the normal operation of three transformers are used-two of them experienced failures in a part of their cooling system. The proposed model and algorithm can be easily implemented and integrated into monitoring systems due to their simplicity and good accuracy. © 2017 IEEE.",Cooling; Cooling systems; Heat transfer; Oil filled transformers; Partial discharges; Power transformers; Thermoelectric equipment; Transformer windings; Dependent variables; Model and algorithms; On-line algorithms; On-line monitoring system; Online monitoring; Overload capability; Thermal modelling; Top oil temperature; Monitoring,Air-forced power transformer; Cooling system; Malfunction detection; Online monitoring; Thermal modelling,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,08858977,,ITPDE,,English,IEEE Trans Power Delivery,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017592403

The effort of promoting the use of EVs in transportation is indispensable to meet the climate change related targets and to reduce the dependency on the ever unstable prices of diminishing fossil fuels. However, there are still many uncertainties in the market regarding the acceptability of EVs by the final consumers. As a new contribution with respect to earlier studies, this paper assesses the impact of EV charging load on the dielectric oil deterioration of two real Power Distribution Transformers (PDTs), one residential and one industrial, located in the insular grid of São Miguel. A PDT thermal model is used to estimate the hot-spot temperature given the load ratio. Real data are used for the main inputs of the model, namely, the daily residential load curve, the daily private industrial client load curve, the PDT parameters, time-of-use rates and EV parameters. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This is due to the fact that their failure may have negative influence on sustainability and quality of energy. In addition, some failures may lead to high cost for replacement or repair and an unplanned outage of a power transformer is highly uneconomical. As a result, as a major equipment in power systems, its correct functioning is vital to enable efficient and reliable operation of electric power system. A transformer can fail due to any combination of electrical, mechanical or thermal stresses. The normal operation life of a transformer is partially related to the deterioration of its insulation through thermal ageing, which is determined mainly by its daily cyclic loadings. In this paper, heat analysis of a 1.5 MVA Oil-Natural Air-Natural cooling mode distribution transformer is experimentally investigated by equipped fiber optic sensors. The density of the fiber optic sensors is increased at the active parts in critical spots. Temperature measurements are realized according to the transformer losses variation and load variation tests. The thermal behavior of the distribution transformer is obtained. Contrary to the existing studies, the obtained results show that also the structure and the design of the transformer affects the hot-spot position and temperature. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Electric power systems; Electric transformer testing; Electric transformers; Fiber optics; Fibers; Finite element method; Oil filled transformers; Outages; Power transformers; Temperature distribution; Temperature measurement; Thermal insulation; Distribution transformer; Normal operations; Oil natural-air natural cooling mode; Quality of energies; Reliable operation; Thermal behaviors; Transformer loss; Unplanned outages; Fiber optic sensors,Distribution transformer; Experimental measurement; Fiber optic sensor; Finite element analysis (FEA); Temperature distribution,"A.Y.

Existing standards and widely used simple calculation models can seriously under/overestimate winding hotspot temperatures under certain circumstances. In this paper, liquid flow and temperature distributions in a physical model representing a disc-type winding in a liquid forced and directed cooling mode are investigated experimentally using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and a temperature measurement system and numerically using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Dimensional analysis is used to generalise the results into a form useful for design review. The operating conditions investigated include different liquid inlet velocities, inlet temperatures, power losses in individual disc segments, and the effect of alternative liquids. It is shown that hotspot temperature and position within the winding are a non-linear function of liquid inlet velocity, with stagnation and reverse flow demonstrated in both experiments and CFD models. Comparisons of liquid flow and temperature distributions between measurements and CFD simulation results show that 2D CFD results are representative when there are no reverse flows and 3D CFD simulations are needed when reverse flows occur. The results are presented first in dimensional forms to show the effect of each parameter, and then in non-dimensional forms to provide a generalised insight into transformer thermal design. © 2019 The Authors",Electric windings; Functions; Liquids; Photolithography; Power transformers; Temperature distribution; Temperature measurement; Velocity measurement; Winding; Dimensional analysis; Disc type winding; Hotspot temperature; Nonlinear functions; Operating condition; Particle image velocimetries; Temperature measurement systems; Transformer; Computational fluid dynamics,CFD; Dimensional analysis; Disc-type winding; PIV; Transformer,"Z.

Dynamic rating of transformers is a fairly new technology if compared to the dynamic rating of power lines, and has a high potential for significantly improving component utilization while lowering investment costs on installing new transformers. The following work investigates how to utilize already operational transformers, which are used for wind farm connection, for expanding wind generation capacity. Also, this paper shows improvements that dynamic transformer rating can bring to both power grid operators and wind farm owners by exploring the economic benefits of expanding wind parks without investing in new power transformers. Connecting additional wind turbines at sites with high wind potential after the wind park is already in exploitation can assist in lowering electricity price and provide a possibility of less risky investment in the wind energy sector. This paper uses transformer thermal modelling and wind farm expansion techniques such as convolution method and product method to investigate to which extent existing wind farms can be expanded using already installed transformer units. Five transformer locations and nine units are studied for finding the potential of dynamic transformer rating for network expansion applications. The analysis shows that the optimal expansion of wind power from a generator perspective is around 30% to 50%, although, it can be limited further by network restrictions. A possibility to use a large component, such as power transformer, closer to its full potential can provide material and cost savings for building new devices and decrease investment costs on manufacturing, transportation and installation of new units. Dynamic rating of power transformers can also increase the socio-economic benefits of renewable energy by lowering electricity price from renewables and incentivize an increased share of green power in electricity markets. © 2020 The Authors",Convolution; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Economic and social effects; Electric power system economics; Electric utilities; Energy policy; Investments; Materials handling; Power transformers; Wind power; Component utilization; Convolution methods; Equipment utilization; Power grid operators; Real time monitoring; Renewable energies; Socio-economic benefits; Transformer ratings; Electric power transmission networks,Dynamic transformer rating; Planning of power systems; Reliability of power components; Wind energy integration,"K.

Relationships of stochasticities in customer loads and DG output with thermal responses of underground cables, overhead lines and distribution transformers are explained. RTTR is applied on all distribution network components with simulated scenarios involving various levels of DG penetration. This study quantifies the potential for an increased DG utilization and an increased potential for new DG installations when RTTR is integrated with distribution management systems. © 2014 The Authors.",Active networks; Distributed power generation; Electric load forecasting; Electric transformers; Electric utilities; Rating; State estimation; Stochastic systems; Active distribution network management; Active distribution networks; Distribution management systems; Distribution transformer; Load forecasting; Power flows; Stochastic loading; Thermal ratings; Network management,Active network management; Distributed generation control; Load forecasting; Power flow; Real-time thermal rating; State estimation,"M.Z.

Such defects (especially minor TTFs) may result in minor changes in terminal currents/voltages as these are undetectable by conventional current and/or voltage-based methods. In this study, a simple, sensitive and robust method is proposed to identify the TTF locations in power transformers by using core flux based technique. In this approach, a few turns must be wrapped around the transformer core legs to sense and detect the related core flux. Passing asymmetrical flux through a transformer core leg (due to a TTF) induces different voltages in the related sensors, which are located at different places. Variation of the core flux in the corresponding sensors indicates the faulty phase and the TTF location on that phase as well. The proposed technique is verified by some simulations and experimental tests. The obtained results show that the proposed technique successfully (i) detects all the TTFs, (ii) identifies the faulty phase, and (iii) specifies the faulty region on the related phase. Although the proposed method requires a few search coils to be installed on the transformer core legs, installing these thin wires will not change the transformer design significantly. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2016.",Power transformers; Conventional currents; Different voltages; Experimental test; Terminal currents; Transformer core; Transformer design; Transformer failure; Turn-to-turn faults; Location,,"F.

This paper presents an active dielectric window (ADW), which is a new concept of combined acoustic emission (AE) and electromagnetic PD detector intended for assembly in a transformer's inspection hatch. The novelty of this design lies in the fact that all structural components of an ultrasonic transducer, i.e., the matching and backing layer, an active piezoelectric element with electrodes, and electrical leads, were built into a dielectric window. Due to the fact that its construction was optimized for work in mineral oil, it is characterized by much higher sensitivity of PD detection than a general-purpose AE sensor mounted outside a transformer tank. Laboratory tests showed that the amplitude of the AE pulses generated by creeping discharges, which were registered by the ADW, was around five times higher on average than the pulses registered by a commonly used contact transducer. A possibility of simultaneous detection of acoustic and electromagnetic pulses (with an integrated ultra-high frequency (UHF) antenna) is an important advantage of the ADW. It allows for an increase in the reliability of PD detection, the accuracy of defect location, and the effectiveness of disturbance identification. This paper describes in detail the applied methods of designing and modeling the ADW components, the manufacturing process of the prototype construction, and the results of preliminary laboratory tests, in which the detector's sensitivity as well as the efficiency of the PD source location were evaluated. © 2018 by the author.",Antennas; Condition monitoring; Electromagnetic pulse; Location; Oil filled transformers; Partial discharges; Power transformers; Transducers; Ultrasonic applications; Ultrasonic transducers; Disturbance identification; Partial discharge detectors; Piezoelectric elements; Power transformer diagnostics; Simultaneous detection; Source location; UHF antennas; Ultra High Frequency (UHF); Acoustic emission testing,acoustic emission (AE); condition monitoring; partial discharge (PD); PD source location; power transformer diagnostics; UHF antenna,"W.

Dynamic rating (DR) provides a possibility to apply improvements to the system both during planning and operation stages. The DR benefits are well described in various literature sources. However, DR is often focused on more efficient exploitation of power lines, not power transformers. Power transformers are costly equipment and their efficient usage and planning can have drastic effect on total costs. Our analysis focuses on the dynamic transformer rating (DTR) for wind energy applications. The main objective is to study reliability effects of DTR from the component perspective. We utilize existing knowledge about transformer heat balance models from IEC and IEEE standards to obtain information on the loss of life (LOL) of the transformer under investigation and propose possible improvements for the system in question. The method can be employed for identifying the appropriate transformer size by taking into account ambient temperature and load variations and then overloading the transformer beyond nameplate ratings. The reliability of the proposed application is ensured by calculating the risk of overloading the transformer for each day of the year. A risk of overloading is quantified as LOL of the transformer. The risk is presented as a function of ambient temperature and duration of an overload. The final step consists of an economic analysis, which demonstrates economic benefits of DTR application. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Economic analysis; IEEE Standards; Power transformers; Reliability; Specific heat; Temperature; Wind power; Energy applications; Heat balance; Integration technologies; Loss of life; Renewable energy source; Risk of overloading; Transformer ratings; Wind energy integration; Economic and social effects,Dynamic transformer rating; Heat balance; Loss of life; Wind energy,"K.

Previous studies have focused mainly on some single type of dielectric measurement method. However, the condition of oil paper insulation in transformer is affected by many factors, so it is difficult to predict the insulation status by means of a single method. In this paper, the insulation condition assessment is performed by grey relational analysis (GRA) technique after carefully investigating different dielectric response measurement data. The insulation condition sensitive parameters of samples with unknown insulation status are extracted from different dielectric response measurement data and then these are used to contrast with the standard insulation state vector models established in controlled laboratory conditions by using GRA technique for predicting insulation condition. The performance of the proposed approach is tested using both the laboratory samples and a power transformer to demonstrate that it can provide reliable and effective insulation diagnosis. © 2017 MDPI AG.

A numerical model of the heat transfer from the transformer to its surroundings by natural convection has been developed. Firstly, a steady regime with the transformer working at full load at an ambient temperature of 300 K is studied in order to gain insight into the heat transmission mechanisms. Then, a series of 32 steady simulations with different load and ambient conditions is performed to characterize insulation aging due to overheating. Finally, a second group of 9 transient simulations is employed to assess the transformer failure time under an overload situation. The results show a coupling between the thermal and flow fields. The hot spot temperatures obtained by the model are consistent with previous experimental observations and the time that the transformer resists an overload has been calculated. The results obtained allow the prediction of the thermal behavior of a transformer under different scenarios, reducing the need for instrumentation, as well as experimental tests which result in the loss of the testing transformer. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Computational fluid dynamics; Failure analysis; Heat transfer; Insulation; Numerical analysis; Numerical models; Outages; Power transformers; Thermal insulation; Ambient conditions; Dry-type transformer; Electro-thermal effects; Hotspot temperature; Power transformer insulation; Power transformer loss; Transformer failure; Transient simulation; Electric transformer testing,Electrothermal effects; Failure analysis; Numerical analysis; Power transformer insulation; Power transformer losses,,,Elsevier Ltd,13594311,,ATENF,,English,Appl Therm Eng,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018490413

Unlike previous work considering surveys based on internal combustion engine-based vehicle data (e.g., National Household Travel Survey (NHTS)) are used in estimating the charging demand of PEVs, this work considers actual PEVs charging data based on the 2015 Canadian Plug-in Electric Vehicle Survey (CPEVS). This work further quantifies the resultant aging seen on substation transformers when internal combustion engine-based National Household Travel Survey data as compared to plug-in electric vehicle driving data from the Canadian Plug-in Electric Vehicle Survey. Moreover, a comparison of the substation transformer aging is performed based on varying plug-in electric vehicle charging levels. Results of the scenarios have shown substation transformer loss of life is found to be at least 30% higher when vehicle data is based on plug-in electric vehicle studies versus conventional internal combustion engine vehicles with 0% PV penetration, up to twice as high at 100% PV penetration. Further studies have shown grouped plug-in electric vehicle charging using 3.3 kW at 7 pm results in twice the transformer aging seen versus plug-in electric vehicles charging beginning upon returning home. Finally, results have shown that the effect of rooftop solar PV owned by residential prosumers was found to reduce substation transformer loss-of-life by 75% in the case of 3.3 kW plug-in electric vehicle charging when 100% PV penetration was added to the system.

These intrinsic nonlinear loads generate prominent level distortion of the electric current waveforms, which lead to additional losses and thermal stress within the power supply distribution system. Thus, due to the supplementary harmonic losses, the power transformer, experience an increase of its hot-spot temperature that may cause the machine insulation failure and ultimately the transformer lifetime expectancy reduction. In order to overcome these undesirable consequences, the reduction of the apparent power rating of the transformer (derating) is commonly adopted. This paper quantitatively investigates the nonsinusoidal steady state of the transformer by evaluating the losses distribution within the machine, its hot-spot temperature rise and the corresponding transformer loss of life. The computation procedure is exemplified on a 250 kVA liquid filled three-phase power distribution transformer that supplies both linear and nonlinear industrial loads. © 2017 IEEE.",Electric losses; Electric machinery; Electric power systems; Electric transformers; Energy efficiency; Power quality; Power transformers; derating; Harmonics loss; High energy efficiency; Hotspot temperature; Power distribution transformer; Power electronic devices; Power supply distribution; Transformer loss of lives; Electric power distribution,derating; harmonics losses; hot-spot temperature; power quality; power transformer; transformer loss of life,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-150906691-9,,,English,"Int.

A major research effort has therefore focused on detecting failures of their insulating systems prior to unexpected machine outage. Although several industrial methods exist for the online and offline monitoring of power transformers, all of them are expensive and complex, and require the use of specific electronic instrumentation. For these reasons, this paper will present online analysis of transformer leakage flux as an efficient alternative procedure for assessing machine integrity and detecting the presence of insulating failures during their earliest stages. A 12-kVA 400-V/400-V power transformer was specifically manufactured for the study. A finite-element model of the machine was designed to obtain the transient distribution of leakage flux lines in the machine's transversal section under normal operating conditions and when shorted turns are intentionally produced. Very cheap and simple sensors, based on air-core coils, were built in order to measure the leakage flux of the transformer, and nondestructive tests were also applied to the machine in order to analyze pre and postfailure voltages induced in the coils. Results point to the ability to detect very early stages of failure, as well as locating the position of the shorted turn in the transformer windings. © 2007 IEEE.",Condition monitoring; Electric instrument transformers; Electric transformer insulation; Electric transformer testing; Finite element method; Insulation; Location; Nondestructive examination; Theorem proving; Transformer substations; Transformer windings; Alternative procedures; Early detections; Early stages; Electrical systems; Electronic instrumentations; Element models; Finite-element method (FEM); Industrial methods; Insulating systems; Leakage flux analysis; Leakage fluxes; Nondestructive tests; Normal operating conditions; Offline monitoring; Online analysis; Online methods; Remote condition monitoring; Research efforts; Shorted turns; Transient distributions; Power transformers,Diagnosis; Finite-element method (FEM); Leakage flux analysis; Power transformers insulation,"M.F.

Failure of a power transformer would not only result in a downtime to the entire transmission and distribution networks but may also cause personnel and environmental hazards due to oil leak and fire. Hence, to enhance a transformer’s reliability and extend its lifespan, a cost-effective and reliable condition monitoring technique should be adopted from day one of its installation. This will help detect incipient faults, extend a transformer’s operational life, and avoid potential conse-quences. With the global trend to establish digital substation automation systems, transformer online condition monitoring has been given much attention by utilities and researchers alike. Several online and offline condition monitoring techniques have been recently proposed for oil-immersed power transformers. This paper is aimed at providing a state-of-the-art review for the various condition monitoring technologies used for oil-immersed power transformers.

The influence of wind velocity and the direction to convective heat transfer on each of the outer surfaces is taken into account. The solar calculator is developed and applied to determine the sun irradiation on each of the kiosk surfaces, taking into account shadows on some of the walls. The natural ventilation is modeled using equilibrium of pressure produced due to thermal buoyancy and pressure drop on the air path. The model is validated by comparing calculation results with the results of measurements on the transformer kiosk, with different surfaces of ventilation inlet and outlet openings. The model can be used in design phase to optimize ventilation openings (jalousies).

The overload risk of transformer in emergencies is enlarging, which urgently requires cooperative control of power grid-transformer to avoid catastrophic accidents. Thus, a cooperative control strategy of power grid-transformer considering the dynamic security margin of the transformer in emergencies is proposed in this paper. First, the safety domain model of the transformer is constructed based on the temperature rising model as well as insulation deterioration pattern, and the dynamic security margin of the transformer is evaluated accordingly. Then, targeted counter measures are selected according to the safety status of the transformer, and different control schemes such as emergency overload, topology adjustment, and load shedding are generated by solving the optimization model. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated in various scenarios. The results show that when the security margin of transformer is sufficient, the strategy can fully exploit its overload capability to support grid regulation and avoid premature load shedding; when the security margin is insufficient, load shedding is coordinated to ensure the security of transformer. The proposed strategy can realize the synergistic control and mutual support between power grid safety and equipment safety. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Deterioration; Electric power plant loads; Electric power system control; Electric power transmission networks; Outages; Power control; Power transformers; Renewable energy resources; Safety engineering; Topology; Co-operative control; Control strategies; Dynamic security; Dynamic security margin; Emergency overload; Load capacity; Load-shedding; Mutual support; Power grids; Security margins; Electric load shedding,Dynamic security margin; Emergency overload; Load capacity; Mutual support; Power transformer,"J.

The design is based on the accurate prediction of the lifetime degradation of mineral-oil-immersed transformers subject to highly intermittent loads. In fact, by investigating the nature of the loads in the smart grid scenario, it clearly appears that the intermittent nature of the power demand increases drastically. In this context, specific tools for the characterization of the lifetime duration are required, since severe reduction of the transformer's life can be observed due to overloads, even in the case of short-duration overloads. The classical approaches based on using the equivalent thermal current to predict the transformer's lifetime might result in incorrect estimates, thus requiring advanced models that can deal with the time variability of the load. In this paper, the randomness of the load powers is addressed in terms of stochastic processes. In particular, the Wiener process is demonstrated to provide robust modeling of load variability. By starting from this assumption, it was demonstrated analytically that the hot-spot temperature, which is a major contributor to the degradation of the transformer's lifetime, also is a stochastic process. Then, in spite of the nonlinearity of the thermal model, the hot-spot temperature can be represented as a Wiener process, the robustness of which has been verified adequately. By taking into account the nonlinear relationship between the hot-spot temperature and the lifetime, the authors verified that the transformer's lifetime is modeled as a lognormal, stochastic process. Hence, a novel, closed-form relationship was derived between the transformer's lifetime and the distributional properties of the stochastic load. The usefulness of the closed-form expression is discussed for sake of design, even if a few of the considerations also are performed with respect to operating conditions. The aim of the numerical application was to demonstrate the feasibility and the easy applicability of the analytical methodology. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Codes (symbols); Design; Electric power transmission networks; Random processes; Stochastic systems; Closed-form expression; Distributional property; Lifetime characterization; Log-normal distribution; Non-linear relationships; Oil immersed transformers; Smart grid; Transformer design; aging; analytical method; design; electronic equipment; energy efficiency; nonlinearity; numerical method; optimization; stochasticity; temperature gradient; Smart power grids,Smart grid; Transformer aging; Transformer design,"F.

The sensitivity of results to the uncertainty in model parameters is thoroughly assessed, and acceptable level of uncertainty is determined. The results demonstrated the importance of integration of loading conditions into the failure model.

Temperature control is a paramount concern, as the unexpected high temperature declines the safety and life expectancy of transformer. The scrutiny of losses and thermal-fluid behavior are thereby critical for the design of MF transformers. This paper proposes a coupled, semi-numerical model for electromagnetic and thermal-fluid analysis of MF oil natural air natural (ONAN) transformer. An analytical model that is based on spatial distribution of flux density and AC factor is exploited to calculate the system losses, while the thermal-hydraulic behavior is modelled numerically leveraging the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method. A close-loop iterative framework is formulated by coupling the analytical model-based electromagnetic analysis and CFD-based thermal-fluid analysis to address the temperature dependence. Experiments are performed on two transformer prototypes with different conductor types and physical geometries for validation purpose. Results suggest that the proposed model can accurately model the AC effects, losses, and the temperature rises at different system components. The proposed model is computationally more efficient than the full numerical method but it reserves accurate thermal-hydraulic characterization, thus it is promising for engineering utilization. © 2019 by the authors.",Air; Analytical models; Computational fluid dynamics; Iterative methods; Numerical methods; Oil filled transformers; Temperature distribution; Thermal Engineering; Thermoanalysis; Computational fluid dynamics methods; Electromagnetic analysis; Medium frequency transformer; Oil naturals; Power conversion systems; Temperature dependence; Thermal hydraulic behaviors; Thermal-hydraulic analysis; Numerical models,Electromagnetic analysis; Medium frequency transformer; Oil natural air natural; Thermal-hydraulic analysis,"H.

To minimize future capital expenditure, improved DT design approaches are required. Therefore, a novel DT design approach based on a new paradigm of 'designing for maximum utilization' is proposed. It incorporates manufacturer and customer-sourced empirical data to achieve a desired DT retirement age and utilization rate, and allows for transient operation beyond DT nameplate rating through accurately accounting for thermal inertia. The novelty of the proposed approach derives from not only a new notion of designing for maximum utilization, but also allowing for the fact that winding insulation may not be the most critical factor affecting a DT's lifetime. Using the proposed approach, DT capital expenditure and utilization constraints can be optimized at a planning stage. The algorithm is applied and validated. © 1986-2012 IEEE.",Automobile manufacture; Costs; Distributed power generation; Electric windings; Distribution transformer; Hotspot temperature; Optimisations; Thermal modelling; utilisation; Electric transformers,distributed generation; distribution transformer; hot spot temperature; optimisation; Thermal modelling; utilisation,"M.

Within the typical power asset portfolio, the residential transformer asset is often large in population, has the lowest reliability design, lacks transformer loading data, and is susceptible to customer loading behaviors, such as adoption of distributed energy resources and electric vehicles. On the bright side, the availability of more residential service operation data along with the advancement of data analytics techniques has provided a new path to further our understanding of residential transformer overloading risk statistically. This paper develops a new data-driven method that combines transformer temperature rise and insulation life loss simulation model with clustering analysis technique. It quantitatively and statistically assesses the overloading risk of residential transformer population in one area and suggests proper risk management measures according to the assessment results. Multiple application examples for a Canadian utility company have been presented and discussed in detail to demonstrate the applicability and usefulness of the proposed method. © 1986-2012 IEEE.",Electric losses; Electric transformers; Electric utilities; Energy resources; Housing; Population statistics; Reliability; Risk management; Unsupervised learning; Clustering methods; Distributed Energy Resources; Life estimation; Multiple applications; Power system reliability; Risk assessment methods; Risk management measures; Transformer overloading; Risk assessment,clustering methods; life estimation; Power system reliability; transformers; unsupervised learning,"M.

To prevent these difficulties, the rated power of a transformer supplying nonlinear loads or unbalanced load is reduced; commonly known as derating. In this paper, an alternative to traditional loss based derating is proposed. It is shown that derating might actually not be required when contrasted with the traditional approach.

However, the accuracy is greatly limited by selection of DGA features and performance of fault diagnostic model. This paper proposed a fault diagnostic method integrating feature selection and diagnostic model optimization. Firstly, this paper set up three feature sets with eight basic DGA gases, 28 DGA gas ratios and 36 hybrid DGA features, respectively. Then, to eliminate the interference of weak-relevant and irrelevant features, the genetic-algorithm-SVM-feature-screen (GA-SVM-FS) model was built to screen out the optimal hybrid DGA features subset (OHFS) from three feature sets. Next, using the OHFS as the input, the support vector machine (SVM) multi-classifier optimized by ISGOSVM (SVM classifier optimized by improved social group optimization) was built to diagnose fault types of transformers. Finally, the performance of OHFS and ISGOSVM diagnostic model was tested and compared with traditional DGA features and diagnostic models, respectively. The results show that the OHFS screened out is comprised of 14 features, including 12 gas ratios and two gases. The accuracy of OHFS is 3-30% higher than traditional DGA features, and the accuracy of ISGOSVM can increase by 3% to 14% compared with the SGOSVM (SVM classifier optimized by social group optimization), GASVM (SVM classifier optimized by genetic algorithm optimization), PSOSVM (SVM classifier optimized by particle swarm optimization), and SVM diagnostic models. The proposed approach integrating the OHFS with ISGOSVM achieves the highest accuracy of fault diagnose (92.86%). © 2018 MDPI AG.

Different parameters were tested, namely the oil temperature, the oil inlet velocity and the duration of the sinusoidal perturbation. The dynamic friction factor was calculated as a function of the Reynolds number. For fast perturbations, the discrepancies between the calculated dynamic and the steady-state friction factor are observed only during the short-term period of the perturbation. For smooth and longer perturbations, the system slowly redistributes the oil flow through the radial channels and differences to initial steady-state are not as noticeable. Overall, the curve fit obtained for steady-state conditions is valid for transient conditions.

In this paper, both experimental and numerical investigations of liquid flow and temperature distributions in a disc-type winding model are conducted. The influences of representative operating conditions on liquid flow and temperature distributions are studied using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and temperature measuring systems. Reverse liquid flows and consequential localised overheating at the top part of winding passes are recorded in the experiments. 2D and 3D CFD simulations are implemented and compared with the measurements. 3D CFD simulations are required for reliable predictions of temperature distribution when reverse flows occur. Dimensional analysis is adopted to interpret the measurement and CFD simulation results in order to provide simplicity, insight and universally applicable conclusions. The liquid flow and temperature distributions are found to be mainly controlled by the Richardson number (Ri). The higher Ri the more uneven the liquid flow and temperature distributions would be. At low Ri region flow and temperature distributions are relatively uniform with a low hotspot factor. Above the region, flow and temperature distributions become rapidly uneven and the hotspot factor increases steeply with the increase of Ri. Further increase of Ri results in the occurrence of reverse flows and fluctuation of the hotspot factor. © 2019 The Authors",Liquids; Oil filled transformers; Power transformers; Temperature distribution; Transformer windings; Velocity measurement; Winding; Dimensional analysis; Disc type winding; Numerical investigations; Operating condition; Particle image velocimetries; Richardson number; Temperature measuring system; Transformer; Computational fluid dynamics,CFD; Dimensional analysis; Disc-type winding; ON; PIV; Transformer,"Z.

However, due to the intrinsic uncertainties involved in the dynamic thermal rating estimation, the problem should be framed within a probabilistic environment. This paper focuses on distribution transformers; a novel non-parametric stress-strength model is presented in order to estimate the probability of the stress (i.e., the transformer loading current) to be smaller than the strength (i.e., the dynamic transformer rating). The model is based on a logistic regression of the companion binomial regression problem.

In order to realize the batch prediction of hot-spot temperature (HST) of traction transformer group and perform estimation of thermal capacity well, this article was devoted to HST prediction modeling for traction transformers based on genetic programming (GP). First, the HST, load factor, and ambient temperature data used in this article were measured from the traction transformer A and were further divided into training set and prediction set. Training set was used to driven modeling by GP. An explicit expression prediction model, which could directly predict the dynamic HST, was established. Then, it was confirmed that the model has high accuracy according to the prediction set. Furthermore, the transformers B and C that are belong to the same railway line like A were tracked and predicted in real time. It is verified that the model has high generalization performance. Simultaneously, the practical application of the model was discussed and analyzed. The research result shows it is expected that the proposed model could realize the batch accurate prediction of HST for traction transformer group.

Despite this popularity, interpretation of FRA signatures has not yet been standardized worldwide. Correct interpretation of FRA signatures results in reliable diagnosis of the transformer mechanical integrity which facilitates timely and proper remedial action. As a further step towards the full understanding of the analysis of FRA signatures, this paper presents a k-means method to cluster power transformers under different fault types. In this regard, series of FRA measurements has been conducted on various transformer models under different fault types. Then, a feature based on interval maximum to global maximum (IMGM) is extracted from the obtained FRA measurements to facilitate data clustering. Using grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA), the centers of the clusters are determined and by applying the data obtained from operating transformers, the performance of the proposed method is evaluated and compared under different cases. © 2021",Frequency response; Global optimization; K-means clustering; Power transformers; Clusterings; Condition; Fault types; Frequency response analysis; Grasshopper optimization algorithm; K-means; K-means++ clustering; Mechanical deformation; Optimization algorithms; Reliable methods; Condition monitoring,Condition monitoring; Frequency response analysis; Grasshopper optimization algorithm; k-means clustering; Power transformers,"M.

In this study, a simple, sensitive and robust linkage flux-based technique is proposed to protect the power transformers against TTFs. In this approach, some separated multi-turn windings as search coils (SCs) have to be wrapped around the transformer core legs to sense the related passing flux. Since passing equal flux through a transformer core leg in normal condition induces equal voltages in the related SCs, variation of the induced voltages indicates the fault occurrence in that phase. Against the traditional differential protection schemes, current transformer error and saturation, tap changer operation, energising inrush current, over-fluxing etc. cannot impact the proposed technique performance. Therefore, it can be introduced as a comprehensive protection technique for power transformers.To confirm the proposed technique performance, it is tested on a real 50 kVA, 20 kV/400 V three-phase distribution transformer, in various conditions, too. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",Electric equipment protection; Electric transformers; Power transformers; Transformer windings; Current transformer error; Differential protection; Induced voltages; Normal condition; Protection techniques; Terminal currents; Transformer failure; Turn-to-turn faults; Transformer protection,,"F.

For this purpose, an appropriate thermal equivalent circuit is used in which temperature of differentparts of oil-immersed power transformers are obtained for harmonic loads. The losses of various components of transformer asheat-generating sources are estimated. At this end, an appropriate three-dimensional finite element method is applied toestimate the losses of different parts of transformer.

Although the various methods based on the terminal currents and/or voltages have been presented for transformer protection, the flux-based methods can be used to achieve the more accurate, sensitive, and secure results. Since the symmetrical form of the magnetic flux distribution will be disturbed due to any fault occurrence in the transformer windings, it can be considered as an appropriate criterion to achieve a suitable protection algorithm, which can detect the fault occurrence and identify the faulty phase/region. In this paper, a new leakage flux sensor is introduced and then a flux-based technique is proposed to detect and identify the faulty phase in transformers to apply in online conditions. By using the proposed technique, the faulty region can be identified in offline conditions, as well. The experimental results (which are done on a distribution transformer) show that this technique is secure in the face of overfluxing and transformer energizing conditions and can detect turn-to-turn faults with high sensitivity.

This work aims to address the overload problem and transformer HST and TOT excursions via LTO. First, the equivalent thermal model for the HST and TOT of transformers under external cooling conditions are discussed, and then the corresponding linearized HST and TOT constraints with varied thermal resistances are derived using the discretization method. Moreover, the proposed LTO model is formulated on the reconfigurable topology of high voltage distribution networks (HVDNs) in China. This proposed LTO model can achieve the optimal network reconfiguration scheme subject to temperature limits and system operation constraints, with the least switching operation cost and the maximum margins of reactive power exchange between HVDNs and transmission systems. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed LTO model is validated by the modified IEEE-14 node system and the practical HVDNs in China.  © 1986-2012 IEEE.",Discrete event simulation; Electric power transmission; Topology; Discretization method; Equivalent thermal model; High voltage distribution networks; Hotspot temperature; Optimal network reconfiguration; Switching operations; Top oil temperature; Transmission systems; Temperature,Load transfer optimization; reconfigurable topology; top-oil and hot-spot temperature limits,"Q.

Transformers present a variety of challenging sensing environments such as high levels of electromagnetic interference and limited space for conventional sensors to operate. Immersion of power transformers in insulation oils for thermal management during operation and the presence of relatively large and time-varying electrical and occasional magnetic fields make sensing technologies requiring electrical wires or active power at sensing locations highly undesirable.

First, with the transformer oil-paper insulation system (TOPIS) as the target of evaluation and the winding hot spot temperature (HST) as the core point, an HST-based static ageing failure model is built according to the Weibull distribution and Arrhenius reaction law, in order to describe the transformer ageing process and calculate the winding HST for obtaining the failure rate and life expectancy of TOPIS. A grey target theory based dynamic correction model is then developed, combined with the data of Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) in power transformer oil, in order to dynamically modify the life expectancy calculated by the built static model, such that the corresponding relationship between the state grade and life expectancy correction coefficient of TOPIS can be built. Furthermore, the life expectancy loss recovery factor is introduced to correct the life expectancy of TOPIS again. Lastly, a practical case study of an operating transformer has been undertaken, in which the failure rate curve after introducing dynamic corrections can be obtained for the reliability assessment of this transformer. The curve shows a better ability of tracking the actual reliability level of transformer, thus verifying the validity of the proposed method and providing a new way for transformer reliability assessment. This contribution presents a novel model for the reliability assessment of TOPIS, in which the DGA data, as a source of information for the dynamic correction, is processed based on the grey target theory, thus the internal faults of power transformer can be diagnosed accurately as well as its life expectancy updated in time, ensuring that the dynamic assessment values can commendably track and reflect the actual operation state of the power transformers. © 2018 by the authors.

The studied nanofluids comprise a typical mineral oil as the transformer base fluid in which Magnetite, Copper Oxide and Alumina nanoparticles are individually dispersed assuming different solid volume fractions. The suspensions are assessed in terms of density, specific heat capacity, thermal conductivity and viscosity. Furthermore, volume fraction- and temperature-dependent formulas, well-matched with the existing experimental data, are proposed to demonstrate excellent correlation coefficients. Subsequently, the derived formulas are utilized as initial functions for transformer thermal modeling. Actually, to pursue the mentioned approach, performing electromagnetic analyses are indispensable. In this regard, making use of two nanocrystalline alloys, namely, Finemet FT-3 M and Vitroperm 500F as core materials can significantly reduce the transformer resultant losses once compared to the case in which conventional electrical steels are utilized. In this study, to represent the enhancements found in the nanofluid filled transformer perfectly, in addition to analysis of the simulation results against those gained using pure mineral oil, one type of natural ester, Midel 1204, is designated as another option for comparison purposes. It is worth mentioning that by increasing the level of nanoparticles volume concentration, a notable decrease can be observed not only in the oil average temperature, but also in the winding hot spot temperature. The investigations are performed for the transformer under different load rates considering the influence of ambient temperature, and the results accuracy are authenticated through making qualitative comparison against the thermal image of a prototype magnetic nanofluid-immersed transformer. Moreover, the system resultant temperatures are verified to exhibit the finest magnitudes in presence of the studied nanofluids, even lower than that of the ester oil with an extremely high thermal conductivity. Finally, the studied fluids and nanofluids Nusselt numbers versus Rayleigh numbers are attained to demonstrate the results fine agreement with the experimental values, as well as presenting satisfactory enhancement in CuO nanofluid Nusselt number compared to mineral oil-based Alumina/Magnetite/Titania nanofluids results. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Copper oxides; Coremaking; Magnetite; Metals; Mineral oils; Nanocrystals; Nanofluidics; Oil filled transformers; Power transformers; Specific heat; Volume fraction; Core loss; Core loss reduction; Hotspot temperature; Loss reduction; Nanofluids; Natural air; Oil natural-air natural  three-phase transformer; Oil naturals; Three-phase transformers; Thermoanalysis,Core losses reduction; Hotspot temperature (HST); Nanofluid; Oil natural-air natural (ONAN) three-phase transformer; Thermal analysis,"Z.

Thus, monitoring the conditions of power transformers has evolved, in the sense that a complete characterization of the conditions of oil–paper insulation can be achieved through dissolved gas analysis (DGA) and furan compounds analysis, since these analyses provide a lot of information about the phenomena that occur in power transformers. The Duval triangles and pentagons methods can be used with a high percentage of correct predictions compared to the known classical methods (key gases, International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), Rogers, Doernenburg ratios), because, in addition to the six types of basic faults, they also identify four sub-types of thermal faults that provide important additional information for the appropriate corrective actions to be applied to the transformers. A new approach is presented based on the complementarity between the analysis of the gases dissolved in the transformer oil and the analysis of furan compounds, for the identification of the different faults, especially when there are multiple faults, by extending the diagnosis of the operating conditions of the power transformers, in terms of paper degradation.

Dissolved gas analysis (DGA) methods are widely used for fault diagnosis, however, their accuracy is limited by the selection of DGA features and the performance of fault diagnosis models, for example, the classical support vector machine (SVM), is easily affected by unbalanced training samples. This paper presents a transformer fault diagnosis model based on chemical reaction optimization and a twin support vector machine. Twin support vector machines (TWSVMs) are used as classifiers for solving problems involving unbalanced and insufficient samples. Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) are used for data preprocessing to ensure the effective identification of feature parameters and improve the efficiency and accuracy of fault diagnosis.

Purchase of power transformers is a major contributor for high costs of building new substations. Application of DTR allows to postpone the investment in new power transformers in old substations, thus DTR has a potential to become an economically beneficial technology. A quantitative risk and economic evaluation of DTR application is performed for a wind farm connected transformer and thus for a highly variable load scenario. The risks analyzed in this project are increased loss of insulation life and the risk of dielectric failure, based on the Arrhenius-Weibull model. A comparative net present value calculation has been performed to investigate the profitability of replacing a 19.4 MVA transformer with a 16 MVA dynamically rated transformer. The feasibility of DTR application is analyzed and a methodology is developed to support both transformer manufacturer and potential customers, such as distribution system operators, in the decision-making process of purchasing of dynamically rated transformer for wind energy applications. © 2018 IEEE.",Electric utilities; Investments; Power transformers; Purchasing; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Sales; Wind power; Acceptable risk levels; Decision making process; Economic evaluations; Energy applications; Net present value; Potential customers; Quantitative risk; Transformer ratings; Economic analysis,,"K.

For Offshore Wind Power Plants (OWPPs), as a consequence of intermittent wind generation combined with favorable ambient conditions and strict design regulations, power transformers tend to be over-dimensioned. Experience suggests that transformer lifetime exceeds OWPP life by tens of years, therefore DTR-based design of transformers can facilitate the optimization of OWPP export system. The recent breakthroughs in Thermo-Electric Equivalent (TEE) and aging models of transformers suggest that temporal development of Top Oil (TOT) and Hot Spot (HST) temperatures can be calculated efficiently, which when combined with monitoring of moisture and oxygen development can accurately assess the transformer health in real-time using Degree of Polymerization (DP). However, the economic optimization of offshore windfarms substations using DTR and lifetime utilization-based transformer design during the OWPP planning phase has not been addressed in the literature due to the risks involved in balancing system reliability with windfarm profitability. In this paper, a novel strategy is proposed to utilize transformer DTR for cost optimization of offshore windfarm export system during the OWPP design phase. Net Present Value (NPV) is used to assess capital cost impacts on transformer and Offshore Substation (OSS) design in year 0, and yearly revenue change over OWPP lifetime due to increased losses and possible energy curtailment as a result of smaller transformers. The unique methodology accounts for varying wind turbine availability due to maintenance and concurs with OWPP design requirements for OSS transformer contingency by generating statistical scenarios based on distribution functions and Markov Chain (MC) models respectively. Moreover, the MC models are adapted for two fundamentally different design concepts for OWPP export system: n-1 contingent and non-contingent. The implementation of probabilistic Markov models to resolve stressful periods with increased transformer loading is distinctive to this paper and offers a unique perspective for DTR-based transformer size optimization. Long-term site assessment data for OWPP including historical wind generation is used for transformer thermal assessment (TOT and HST) based on its load and ambient conditions. Furthermore, the reliability of design for varying construction and commissioning conditions is ensured by tracking DP-based transformer lifetime utilization over the operation period for three scenarios of oxygen and moisture development: conservative, high moisture and high oxygen. The case study of a 1200 MW offshore windfarm with two 220 kV parallel export circuits and four 33/220 kV transformers in one OSS located 50 km off the east coast of UK has been used in this paper. 100 scenarios of wind turbine availability and transformer contingency are simulated and the optimal design is determined for the worst-case scenario. Results indicate that optimal transformer rating can result in high thermal stress and minor energy curtailment during extreme contingency conditions for both the design concepts. However, the reduction in transformer size to align with OWPP operation life can reliably improve the windfarm business case significantly, particularly for the n-1 contingent design concept with conservative transformer moisture and oxygen conditions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Availability; Distribution functions; Electric power transmission; Markov chains; Moisture control; Offshore oil well production; Oil filled transformers; Oxygen; Power transformers; Reliability; Thermoelectric power plants; Transformer substations; Wind power; Wind turbines; Degree of polymerization; Dynamic thermal ratings (DTR); Economic optimization; Extreme contingencies; Offshore substations; Offshore wind power plants; Temporal development; Transmission systems; Offshore power plants,Contingency based design; Dynamic transformer rating; Offshore windfarm optimization; Transformer lifetime utilization,"S.H.H.

The heat generation in windings and core, being an effect of the power losses, is usually dissipated in large units by using mineral oils, which are harmful to the environment. Nowadays, the industry and global society seek environmentally-friendly alternatives. One of the most promising substitute for their high biodegradability, safety in operation, and favourable thermo-physical properties are natural ester oils. For this reason, a numerical study of 8.5 MVA disk-type power transformer cooled using conventional mineral oil and a commercially used rapeseed ester oil is presented in this paper. Moreover, due to different thermal behaviour of the considered oils, the comparison was made for the unit working in different seasons of hot and moderate climate zones (Argentina and Poland). In the numerical approach, electromagnetic (EMAG) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models were used for a detailed study of the selected device. In particular, a novel and very efficient EMAG–CFD–CFD coupling procedure was developed to assess the cooling of the large power transformer. Such a coupled computational procedure allowed for the detailed investigation of the power loss, oil flow characteristics, and temperatures with a satisfying computational effort. The results showed that the average windings temperatures are higher by 2–9 K when the ester oil is used, dependent on the ambient conditions. The hotspot temperature in the low voltage windings increased by up to 9 K and up to 18 K in the high voltage windings using ester oil. According to the results, the oil duct construction requires modification in the high voltage region for transformers cooled using mineral oil in cold climate conditions. © 2021 The Authors",Biodegradability; Computational fluid dynamics; Esters; Mineral oils; Minerals; Thermoanalysis; Bio-degradable oil; Biodegradable ester oil; Coupled problems; Disk-type; Dynamics coupling; Electrical energy; Electromagnetics; Ester oil; High-voltages; Powerloss; Power transformers,Biodegradable oil; Computational fluid dynamics; Cooling system; Coupled problem; Electromagnetic; Power transformer,"M.

In apartment complexes, which have emerged as a common residential type in metropolitan areas and highly populated districts, high charging demand could result in substantial stress to distribution networks. In this work, the effect of EV charging power demand in an apartment complex on the aging of the Distribution Transformer (DT) is studied. A methodology based on the stochastic characterization of vehicle usage profiles and user charging patterns is developed to obtain realistic EV charging demand profiles. Based on the modeled EV charging profile and the transformer thermal model, the effect of different EV penetration ratios on DT aging for an apartment complex in the Republic of Korea is studied. Results for an EV penetration ratio of up to 30% indicated that DT aging could be accelerated by up to 40%, compared to the case without EV charging. To mitigate this accelerated DT aging caused by EV charging, the effectiveness of two integration approaches of Photovoltaic (PV) sources was studied. Based on a case study that included a realistic PV generation profile, it was demonstrated that a significant contribution to DT reliability could be achieved via the operation of PV sources. A more apparent contribution of PV integration was observed with an energy storage installation at higher EV penetration ratios. At an EV penetration ratio of 30%, a maximum decrease of 41.8% in the loss-of-life probability of the DT was achieved. The effects of different PV integration approaches and power management details on DT aging were also studied. The results demonstrate that the EV charging demand could introduce a significant level of stress to DTs and that this impact can be effectively mitigated by installing PV sources. These observations are expected to contribute toward the effective planning of power system infrastructures that support the design of sustainable cities with the widespread use of EVs. © 2020 by the authors.

To increase the reliability of the faults’ severity assessment of power transformers, a novel approach in the form of fuzzy logic has been proposed as a new solution to determine faults’ severity using the combination of gas level, gas rate, and DGA interpretation from the Duval Pentagon Method (DPM). A four-level typical concentration and rate were established based on the local population. To simplify the assessment of hundreds of power transformer data, a Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based DPM with high agreements to the graphical DPM has been developed. The proposed approach has been implemented to 448 power transformers and further implementation was done to evaluate faults’ severity of power transformers from historical DGA data. This new approach yields in high agreement with the previous methods, but with better sensitivity due to the incorporation of gas level, gas rate, and DGA interpretation results in one approach. © 2020 by the authors.

The health status of distribution transformers in an electrical grid plays a vital role in maintaining network service continuity, safety from catastrophic events, and reliability of utility operation. Monitoring transformer's health is essential for minimizing outages and extending its life in service. Various diagnostic tests and fault detection techniques have developed to effectively support utility operators in predicting failure, estimating life expectancy and condition monitor its status. For these reasons, traditional and advanced methods are required to reduce maintenance time, cost, and help in finding fault causes and location easily.

Increased EV charging can have a detrimental effect on the distribution grid, especially by causing accelerated aging of transformers. Although many EV smart-charging strategies have been proposed to mitigate this problem, centralized and distributed smart-charging strategies require numerous new infrastructure components and, thus, take time and money to implement. This article proposes the term vehicle-directed smart charging to describe strategies that individual EVs can use to charge in a more intelligent way and, thus, lessen grid impact. This article proposes a new vehicle-directed smart charging concept, random-in-window (RIW), which has fixed-rate and variable-rate variants. The RIW strategy allows for random charging start times within a specific time window after the residential peak load has reduced. The RIW strategies are compared to other strategies using the real-world logged driving data from 150 drivers for one week using long- and short-range EV models. A transformer aging model indicates that the RIW strategies are approximately as good as a fully controlled centralized smart-charging algorithm at EV penetration rates up to 60% for long-range EVs and 70% for short-range EVs. © 2015 IEEE.",Models; Power transformers; Vehicles; Accelerated aging; Battery chargers; Distribution grid; Distribution transformer; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Penetration rates; Smart charging; Thermal factors; Charging (batteries),Battery chargers; modeling; power transformer thermal factors; vehicles,"J.

The proposed method concerns the particular population of mid-voltage (MV) to high-voltage (HV) transformers, a case study of the population of over 1500 units with low average load is analyzed. Three representative real-life working units are selected for the method evaluation and verification. Temperatures used for analysis were measured continuously within two years with 1 h steps.

Accuracy analysis of all applied ML algorithms is discussed and compared to the conventional thermal model. As a result, the best accuracy of the prediction of HS temperatures is yielded by a generalized linear model (GLM) with mean prediction error below 0.71% for winding HS.

This inspection was the result of a specific case of a routine diagnostic procedure that was carried out and, where the transformer was switched off by a Buchholz gas relay. The case studies described were selected such that they represented situations when availability of historical data on the previous measurements was limited and a quick diagnosis had to be made on the basis of the results from the last measurement. In all of the cases presented here, the analysis of the gases dissolved in oil had played an important role in the detection of the defects that turned out to be dangerous for further exploitation of the transformers considered. The first signal about a possible developing defect was elicited solely from the measurements of the oil samples taken from the transformer in service. However, more detailed recognition and initial localization of the defect was possible after additional supplementary measurements (winding resistance, sweep frequency response analysis, etc.), which required the transformer to be switched off. The conducted sequence of actions, based on the developed diagnostic procedure, indicated the possibility of effective and early withdrawal of the transformer from operation, before it underwent a serious failure. © 2019 by the authors.",Defects; Electric resistance; Frequency response; Inspection; Power transformers; Comparative analysis; Diagnostic measurements; Diagnostic methods; Diagnostic procedure; Gases dissolved in oil; Sequence of actions; Sweep frequency response analysis; Winding resistances; Oil filled transformers,DGA; Diagnostic methods; Internal inspection; Oil power transformers,"P.

Dynamic Transformer Rating (DTR) increases the utilization of this asset by limiting its Hot Spot Temperature (HST) rather than the per unit load, thereby increasing available network capacity. However, residual lifetime would still be unutilized according to current dimensioning criteria and state-of-the-art lifetime aging models. This paper proposes a novel methodology for DTR, where both thermal and aging dynamics are accounted for in a multi-period DCOPF formulation. Power losses are accounted for by means of an iterative approach that preserves convexity of the optimization problem. The proposed methodology leads to an optimal lifetime utilization of transformers and favours the integration of wind power generation. This novel DTR approach can be beneficial for applications with limited asset lifetime like offshore windfarms or for postponing grid reinforcements for short period of time. © 2019 IEEE.",Electric load flow; Electric power generation; Iterative methods; Losses; Offshore oil well production; Power transformers; Wind power; Critical power systems; DCOPF; Hotspot temperature; Iterative approach; Lifetime models; Optimization problems; Transformer ratings; Wind power integrations; Electric load dispatching,DCOPF; Dynamic transformer rating; Lifetime model; Losses; Wind power integration,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-153864722-6,,,English,"IEEE Milan PowerTech, PowerTech",Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85072348205

However, subject to electrical, thermal, and mechanical stresses, the condition of a power transformer can eventually deteriorate causing the loss of the transformer's useful life. Utilizing various condition monitoring data of the transformer, this paper applies a state-space model method to the transformer's remaining useful life estimation. In the state-space model, a state dynamic equation considering the transformer aging mechanism is developed. Three measurement equations using different types of condition monitoring data are established. To solve the nonlinear state-space model, a particle filtering approach is applied. The posterior probability density function of the state variable obtained from the particle filtering is used to determine the transformer's remaining useful life.

Taking this into consideration, this paper has two main objectives: i) to analyze the impacts of distributed generation on a non-residential building supplied by a dedicated distribution transformer when this building is converted to a nearly-Zero Energy Building; and ii) to develop a Transformer Anti-Aging Protection System (TAAPS) that mitigates existing negative impacts in order to reduce transformer aging. The present study is based on 1-year, 1-min resolution, real electricity demand and weather data and uses the standard IEC 60076-7 (Loading Guide For Oil-immersed Power Transformers) to model the transformer aging. The collected results show that the introduction of distributed generation increases transformer aging and that the proposed protection system (TAAPS) fulfills its objectives preventing the excessive aging.

In some urban areas, this growth may be faster due to a concentrated EV adoption in affluent neighborhoods; hence, the grid power transformers in such areas may be at risk of accelerated ageing. This impact can be mitigated by using consumer-owned battery energy storage and photovoltaic generation. We propose a coordination approach of utilizing such assets not only to support the distribution grid and maximize consumer profit, but also to mitigate the ageing of the distribution transformers.

Forced circulation of the insulating liquid is used to increase the cooling capacity. A negative effect of such a solution is the creation of the phenomenon of streaming electrification, which in unfavorable conditions may lead to damage to the insulating system of the transformer. This pAper presents results of research confirming the possibility of using fullerene C60 to reduce the phenomenon of streaming electrification generated by the flow of liquid dielectrics. The volume charge density qw was used as a material indicator to determine the electrostatic charging tendency (ECT) of nanofluids. This pArameter was determined from the Abedian-Sonin electrification model on the basis of electrification current measurements and selected physicochemical and electrical properties of the liquid. The electrification current was measured in a flow system with an aluminum pipe of 4 mm diameter and 400 mm length. All measurements were carried out at a temperature of 20◦ C. The influence of flow velocity (from 0.34 m/s to 1.75 m/s) and C60 concentration (25 mg/L, 50 mg/L, 100 mg/L, 200 mg/L and 350 mg/L) was analyzed on the electrification of fresh and aged Trafo En mineral oil, as well as Midel 1204 natural ester and Midel 7131 synthetic ester. The density, kinematic viscosity, dielectric constant, and conductivity were also determined. A negative effect of the C60 doping on the electrostatic properties of fresh mineral oil was demonstrated. For other liquids, fullerene C60 can be used as an inhibitor of the streaming electrification process. Based on the analysis of the qw pArameter, the optimum concentration of C60 (from 100 mg/L to 200 mg/L) resulting in the highest reduction of the electrification phenomenon in nanofluids was identified. © 2022 by the author.

Nowadays, several works have reported that the chemical and electrical-based transformer insulation diagnostic parameters (absorption ratio, polarization index, paper conductivity, oil conductivity, insulation resistance, etc.) can be easily calculated from the PDC data. It is a fact that before using these parameters to obtain the status of deteriorated transformers, the power engineers should prudently investigate the effectiveness of these parameters. However, there are few papers that investigate the important issue. In addition, the understanding of temperature effect mechanism on these parameters should also be prudently studied. In the present work, we firstly prepare several oil-impregnated pressboard specimens with various insulation statuses by using a sequence of thermal ageing and moisture absorption experiments launched in the laboratory, and then the PDC measurement is performed to obtain the chemical and electrical-based transformer insulation diagnostic parameters. Finally, we systematically interpret the effectiveness and temperature effect mechanism on these chemical and electrical-based transformer insulation diagnostic parameters. © 2018 by the authors.",Chemical analysis; Depolarization; Oil filled transformers; Polarization; Temperature; Thermal insulation; Effectiveness; Effectiveness analysis; Insulation resistance; Paper conductivities; Polarization and depolarization currents; Polarization indices; Transformer; Transformer insulation; Paper,Chemical and electrical-based transformer insulation diagnostic parameters; Dielectric monitoring/diagnostic tool; Effectiveness; Polarization and depolarization current (pdc); Temperature effect mechanism; Transformer,"J.

The method combines three basic models; a physical winding degradation model, a health index model based on condition monitoring data combined with expert judgement, and a statistics-based end-of-life model. The statistics-based model uses data from a database of scrapped transformers under development in Norway. Combining the first two models with the statistics-based model, an individual and condition-dependent probability of breakdown is obtained. From this, the expected remaining life is calculated. Finally, the stochasticity of the method is utilized for optimization of maintenance and replacement. The method hence provides key decision support for transformer managers, enabling them to identify transformers in poor condition, and to follow-up and prioritize transformers for maintenance and replacement. The proposed method has been implemented in a transformer asset management tool for Norwegian utilities. The usefulness of the method is illustrated by applying it to selected transformers from one of these utilities.

Local insulation defects can result in serve failures such as breakdowns with severe subsequent costs. The prevention of such events is crucial. Hence, partial discharge (PD) activity at power transformers is evaluated directly in the factory before shipment. Additionally, PD activity can be monitored during service using the ultra-high frequency (UHF) method. In this contribution, a calibration procedure is proposed for the UHF method. The calibration process is required to ensure both, reproducibility and comparability of UHF measurements: Only a calibrated UHF measurement procedure can be introduced supplementary to IEC 60270 in acceptance tests of power transformers. The proposed calibration method considers two factors: The influence of the UHF-antenna’s sensitivity and the PD recorder characteristics including accessories such as cable damping, pre-amplifier, etc. The former is addressed by a characterization of UHF sensors using the standard antenna factor (AF) in a gigahertz transverse electromagnetic (GTEM) cell. The PD recorder’s influence is corrected by using a defined, invariable test signal as reference for all recording devices. A practical evaluation of the proposed calibration procedure is performed in a laboratory setup using different UHF recording devices and UHF sensors using artificial PD signals and real voltage-driven PD sources. © 2019 by the authors.",Antennas; Calibration; Electric transformer testing; Monitoring; Palladium; Partial discharges; Power transformers; Antenna factor; Calibration method; Calibration procedure; Calibration process; Giga-hertz Transverse ElectroMagnetic (GTEM) cell; IEC 60270; Partial discharge measurements; Ultra high frequency method; Acceptance tests,Acceptance tests; Antenna factor; Calibration; IEC 60270; Monitoring; Partial discharge; PD; PD sensors; Power transformers; UHF,"M.

The measurement procedures of FRA are stand-ardized as described in the IEEE and IEC standards. However, the interpretation of FRA results is far from reaching an accepted and definitive methodology as there is no reliable code available in the standard. As a contribution to this necessity, this paper presents an intelligent fault detection and classification algorithm using FRA results. The algorithm is based on a multilayer, feedforward, backpropagation artificial neural network (ANN). First, the adaptive frequency division algorithm is developed and various numerical indicators are used to quantify the differences between FRA traces and obtain feature sets for ANN. Finally, the classification model of ANN is developed to detect and classify different transformer conditions, i.e., healthy windings, healthy windings with saturated core, mechanical deformations, electrical faults, and reproducibility issues due to different test conditions. The database used in this study consists of FRA measurements from 80 power transformers of different designs, ratings, and different manufacturers. The results obtained give evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed classification model for power transformer fault diagnosis using FRA. © 2021 by the authors.

Whether it is detecting faults or partial discharges that take place in high voltage equipment, or detecting contamination and degradation of outdoor insulators, deep learning which is a branch of machine learning has been extensively investigated. Instead of using hand-crafted manual features as an input for the traditional machine learning algorithms, deep learning algorithms use raw data as the input where the feature extraction stage is integrated in the learning stage, resulting in a more automated process. This is the main advantage of using deep learning instead of traditional machine learning techniques. This paper presents a review of the recent literature on the application of deep learning techniques in monitoring high voltage apparatus such as GIS, transformers, cables, rotating machines, and outdoor insulators. © 2022 by the authors.

Nevertheless, the majority of the loads from modern electric installations are intrinsically nonlinear and consequently, they generate nonsinusoidal currents. These high-order harmonics (present into the current waveform spectrum) have a negative impact on the transformers thermal and electrical operating parameters and, ultimately, limit the machine loading capability. The paper quantitatively investigates the transformer behavior under distorted current conditions by developing a procedure for evaluating different relevant operating quantities (maximum permissible current, the hottest spot temperature, aging acceleration factor and the machine remaining lifetime). The computation relays on the international standard recommendation and mainly uses the load current harmonic spectrum and the transformer rated data. To reveal the proposed procedure performance, a distribution transformer of 400 kVA from an industrial plasterboard facility is investigated. © 2018 IEEE.",Electric load distribution; Harmonic analysis; Oil filled transformers; Power quality; Derating; Distribution transformer; Electric installations; Harmonics; Hotspot temperature; Hottest-spot temperatures; International standards; Power distribution transformer; Electric power distribution,Derating; Distribution transformers; Harmonics; Hot spot Temperature; Power Quality,"E.

The optimal rating is derived based on the probabilistic analyses of wind power generation through the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck stochastic process and on thermal model of the transformer through the integration of stochastic differential equations. These analyses allow the stochastic characterization of lifetime reduction of the transformer and then its optimal rating through a simple closed form. The numerical application highlights the effectiveness and easy applicability of the proposed methodology. The proposed methodology allows deriving the rating of transformers which better fits the specific peculiarities of wind power generation. Compared to the conventional approaches, the proposed method can better adapt the transformer size to the intermittence and variability of the power generated by wind farms, thus overcoming the often-recognized reduced lifetime. © 2021 by the authors.

Thermal aging of transformer insulation system determines its reliable life. To achieve an estimation of the insulation life of traction power transformers operated under real load condition, the effects of traction loads on the thermal aging of oil-paper insulation in traction transformers were investigated. First, the design principles for the accelerated thermal aging experiment were studied and proposed by considering magnitude (i.e., load rate) and frequency (i.e. spare time and lasting time) of the traction load. Then, an experimental system was established in the laboratory to conduct extensive accelerated thermal aging experiments, in which the traction loads were mimicked by using positive temperature coefficient (PTC) heating plates and a programmable logic controller (PLC).

ES can be stationary inside buildings or mobile as a part of plug-in electric vehicles (PEV). The use of ES have merits such as peak shaving, load shifting, and backup power supply in the case of loss of power from the grid. The mobile ES poses challenges to the system since the connection location and time may be random. In this paper, the impacts of the stationary and mobile ES on the distribution transformers loss of life are quantified employing a probabilistic approach. Monte Carlo simulation is utilized to model the stochastic behavior of PEVs. For residential demand, ambient temperature and photovoltaic (PV) generation real data from College Station, Texas is used. Using the historical data of one year in this area, the impacts of different ES penetration level in the presence of PEV and PV are studied. This paper provides a better understanding of the negative effects of PEVs on transformers aging and how ES can be employed to mitigate the loss-of-life risk. © 2019 IEEE.",Digital storage; Electric automobiles; Electric transformers; Energy storage; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Photovoltaic cells; Plug-in electric vehicles; Probability distributions; Risk assessment; Smart power grids; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Backup power supplies; Distribution transformer; Loss of life; Photovoltaic generation; Plug in Electric Vehicle (PEV); Power distribution system; Probabilistic approaches; Transformer loss of lives; Electric power transmission networks,energy storage; loss of life; photovoltaic generation; risk assessment,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-153868218-0,,,English,"Proc.

When solving the coupling problem by sequential iterations, the effect of temperature on the material property and the loss density of the windings should be taken into account. In order to improve the computation efficiency for the coupling fields, an algorithm, which adopts two techniques, the dimensionless LSFEM and the combination of Jacobi preconditioned conjugate gradient method (JPCGM) and the two-side equilibration method (TSEM), is proposed in this paper. To validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, a local winding model of a transformer is built and the fluid field is computed by the conventional LSFEM, dimensionless LSFEM, and the Fluent software. While the fluid and thermal computation results of the local winding model of a transformer obtained by the two LSFEMs are basically consistent with those of the Fluent software, the stiffness matrix, which is formed by the dimensionless scheme of LSFEM and preconditioned by the JPCGM and TSEM, has a smaller condition number and a faster convergence rate of the equations. Thus, it demonstrates a broader applicability. © 2018 by the authors.

These gases are generated in oils as a result of electrical and thermal stresses, but these DGA techniques cannot identify the severity of the fault types. In IEEE Standard C57.104, the maintenance action is taken based on the total dissolved combustible gases, which is not sufficient because it ignores the importance of the gas type and its change rate. Thermodynamic theory using different starting decomposing materials, namely, n-octane (C8H18) and eicosane (C20H42), is used to estimate the severity of transformer fault types. Two scenarios are suggested with different data transformation techniques to enhance neural pattern-recognition (NPR) method accuracy for predicting transformer fault types and their severity classes. The proposed scenarios are built based on 446 samples collected from the laboratory and literature. Results refer to the role of the starting decomposing material on the severity of the transformer fault and illustrate that the proposed model has a higher accuracy (92.8%) compared with other DGA methods for diagnosing transformer fault types and superior accuracy (99.1%) to predict fault severity class. © 2020",Dissolution; Forecasting; Gases; IEEE Standards; Metadata; Power transformers; Class prediction; Data transformation; Dissolved gas analyses (DGA); Fault severities; Maintenance Action; Neural patterns; Thermodynamic theory; Transformer faults; Pattern recognition,Dissolved gas analysis; Fault severity; Neural pattern recognition; Transformer faults,"S.S.M.

Further, the quantities of inspection data have not been fully utilized. To improve the accuracy of transformer diagnosis, this study establishes a diagnosis model based on fuzzy association rules combined with case-based reasoning (CBR) to evaluate the failure types, fault locations, and cause of breakdown in power transformers. First, the inspection data of transformers are collected from several substations over 10 years. Then, the preprocessed data are randomly separated into training and testing sets. For the training set, fuzzy association rules are built for multiple parameters to narrow the search scope of base case preliminarily. Next, CBR is applied to determine the most similar cases. The failure information of the target transformer can be obtained in detail along with the most similar base case. Finally, the accuracy of the model is validated shown in case studies using the testing data set. The result demonstrates that the diagnosis model provides a higher accuracy than the classic IEC 60599 three-ratio method used in the current industry, which means that this diagnosis model has better performance on diagnosis accuracy. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2020",Association rules; Failure analysis; Fuzzy rules; Outages; Power transformers; Statistical tests; Casebased reasonings (CBR); Failure information; Fuzzy association rule; Multiple parameters; Three-ratio methods; Training and testing; Transformer diagnosis; Transformer failure diagnosis; Case based reasoning,,"M.

The dissolved gas analysis (DGA) method, which compares the gas concentration to the pre-set threshold, is most widely used for transformer status warning. However, existing standards apply either single threshold value or rough classification to diversified transformers with different properties, which therefore affects the accuracy of status warning. This paper establishes a differentiated warning rule through big data analysis mining. The Fuzzy C -means method is applied to identify optimal transformer properties, which can reflect the individualized characteristics of transformer to the best extent. As verified by the probability plot, the full sets of dissolved gas data under the selected properties conform to the Weibull Model. Association analysis is then carried out between the dissolved gas distribution characteristics and defect/ fault rate, and the warning thresholds are accordingly calculated. Correlating the gas concentration and gas increase rates with established warning values, the transformer operation status can be identified. The verification test indicates that the differentiated warning rule shows better performance than conventional methods and demonstrates an accuracy as high as 98.21%. © 2020",Big data; Dissolution; Gases; Power transformers; Weibull distribution; Association analysis; Conventional methods; Dissolved gas analyses (DGA); Fuzzy C means method; Gas concentration; Online monitoring; Rough classification; Verification tests; Data mining,Big data mining; Differentiated warning rule; Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA); Status assessment; Transformer,"B.

Turn-to-turn fault (TTF) is one of the most common faults in transformer that causes catastrophic events such as transformer explosion, winding, or core deformation. Conventional differential relay is a common device for protection of transformer protection, and it can diagnose the severe TTF; however, it fails to detect the TTF at incipient stage. Recently, several methods and techniques have been introduced to improve the differential relay performance against TTFs. These approaches use various quantities such as current/voltage, frequency, and magnetic flux to detect the TTF in transformer winding. This paper reviews and compares various online and offline TTF diagnosis methods. Moreover, the advantages and disadvantages of these methods are discussed in the paper to analyze their performance in different conditions. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Electric fault location; Electric power system protection; Electric relays; Electric transformers; Power transformers; Transformer windings; Winding; Catastrophic event; Core and windings; Diagnosis methods; Differential protection; Differential relay; Fault identifications; Transformer explosions; Turn-to-turn faults; Transformer protection,differential protection; fault identification; fault location; transformer protection; transformers; turn-to-turn fault,"J.

A numerical study has been conducted in steady state for a step-down 3-phase power transformer in columns immersed in a mineral oil bath inside of a tank. Our main objective is the cooling optimization of the power transformer. An obstacle is used at the inferior part of the transformer in order to conduct the oil to the hottest surface. In order to study the influence of the different parameters on both the heat transfer and the fluid flow we have made use of the highest and the bulk temperature as well as the volume flow rate and dimensionless numbers Re and RiRe in every channel.

This research is motivated in extending life of transformer by using demand response as an operational strategy where the demand response events are issued by predicting overheating of transformer before it occurs. In this paper heating ventilation and air conditioning is considered as a flexible load for responding to demand response events. A demo site is created at 11 KV/440 V substation with 1.6 MVA transformer at Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad (IITH) campus and the proposed architecture and algorithm is implemented. This substation supplies power to chiller plant and three academic buildings with heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC). Analysis for improving the transformer lifetime is carried out for 5 consecutive days during the period (25–29)th Feb 2020 using real time field data. It is observed that during this period 11 demand response events occurred with a total demand response of 919 kWH. From the obtained results it is observed that there is a saving of 15 hoursof transformer life within a period of 5 days (120 hours) of transformer operation. The key contribution in this paper is to bring together three concepts transformer lifetime estimation, HVAC flexibility and demand response for improving the transformer lifetime. © 2020",Electric transformers; Heat pump systems; HVAC; Office buildings; Commercial building; Distribution transformer; Heating ventilation and air conditioning; Indian institute of technologies; Lifetime estimation; Lifetime improvement; Operational strategies; Proposed architectures; Air conditioning,Building management system; Demand response; HVAC; Transformer ageing,"C.

Predicting its life time is desirable, especially, if a zero downtime policy is applied. However, end customers often have to deal with a lack of information and cannot always use the established methods for life time prediction. Therefore, the present paper provides an alternative way to calculate the hot spot temperature and thus, the life time of power transformers based on limited information, i.e. transformer rating information and rms current and voltage measurements (including phase angles). The transformer hot spot temperature is derived from the transformer losses and a virtual twin. Therefore, the paper provides methods i) to evaluate the separate transformer losses, i.e. core, winding and stray losses, ii) to create a simple virtual transformer twin and iii) to calculate the temperature distribution in the transformer windings and thus, the hot spot temperature. The methods are applied to one phase of a 154 kV, 15MVA power transformer. It is shown that the calculated losses and hot spot temperature matches with winding measurements available in literature. © 2020 The Authors",Forecasting; Power transformers; Winding; Electrical distribution networks; End customers; Hotspot temperature; Lifetime prediction; Limited information; Transformer hot-spot temperatures; Transformer loss; Transformer ratings; Transformer windings,Transformer hot spot temperature; Transformer loss calculation; Transformer temperature distribution; Transformer vector diagram; Virtual twin,"D.P.

Historically, research works on dynamic rating have been focused on real-time/near-future system operations. There has been a lack of research for long-term planning oriented applications. Currently, most utility companies still rely on static rating numbers when planning power transformers for the next few years. In response, this paper proposes a novel and comprehensive method to analyze the past 5-year temperature, loading and load composition data of existing power transformers in a planning region. Based on such data and the forecasted area load composition, a future power transformer's load shape profile can be constructed by using Gaussian Mixture Model. Then according to IEEE std. C57.91-2011, a power transformer thermal aging model can be established to incorporate future loading and temperature profiles. As a result, annual continuous dynamic rating profiles under different temperature scenarios can be determined. The profiles can reflect the long-term thermal overloading risk in a much more realistic and granular way, which can significantly improve the accuracy of power transformer planning. A real utility application example in Canada has been presented to validate and demonstrate the practicality and usefulness of this method. © 1986-2012 IEEE.",Gaussian distribution; IEEE Standards; Thermal aging; Application examples; Comprehensive method; Continuous dynamics; Data-driven methods; Gaussian Mixture Model; Long term dynamics; Long term planning; Temperature profiles; Power transformers,Dynamic rating; Gaussian mixture model; Long-term sytem planning; Transformer thermal aging,"M.

In extended thermal equivalent circuits (TECs), less attention has been paid to losses and temperature distribution of different parts such as core, tank and metallic regions of transformer. Most previous works, hot-spot temperature of winding and top-oil were considered by available no-load and on-load losses of transformer. This paper extends the TEC to be able to evaluate fully the different operating conditions of transformer. Estimation of losses of different elements of transformer as heat generating source and thermal parameters of transformer are introduced as two major challenges of the proposed model. At this end, an appropriate three-dimensional finite element method is used to estimate the losses of different components of power transformer. In addition, to identify the transformer thermal parameters, a genetic algorithm is used by searching in chosen measurements. Finally, the results obtained by the TEC are compared with IEEE-Annex G method and measured temperature and high accuracy of the proposed model in temperature estimation in different parts of transformer are shown. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Circuit simulation; Finite element method; Genetic algorithms; Oil filled transformers; Parameter estimation; Power transformers; Temperature distribution; Thermoanalysis; Thermoelectricity; Timing circuits; Different operating conditions; Hotspot temperature; Measured temperatures; Power transformers insulation; Temperature estimation; Thermal equivalent circuit; Thermal parameters; Three-dimensional finite element method; Equivalent circuits,equivalent circuit; finite elements method; power transformers,"J.

The model opts for the optimal combination of corrective actions among load curtailment (LC), DR, and shifting load to an adjacent substation while maintaining the winding hot-spot-temperature (HST) under a predefined limit. Simulations are performed, on a typical Finnish two-transformer primary distribution substation as a test system, for case studies of demand with and without DR & two situations based on availability of neighboring substation connection.

In practice however, thermal limits are usually considered only in operations; but not at planning stage, where the more usual notion of rated power is used. This paper proposes a novel method to take into account (and benefit from) thermal limits directly at planning stage. This is made possible by quantifying separately the impact of each generator and load on the temperature of the distribution transformer. Decoupling the effect of individual generators and loads is achieved by linearizing and rewriting the analytical expression of the hot-spot transformer temperature. The practical value of the method is assessed using a real-world dataset, by estimating the increase in the hosting capacity of the considered transformer for additional generators and loads. Significant gains are obtained when the transformer is sized by generation, in particular when photovoltaic (PV) generators are involved. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Electric power transmission networks; Power transformers; Smart power grids; Analytical expressions; Distribution transformer; Dynamic thermal ratings; Hosting capacity; Planning stages; Power systems planning; Smart grid; Thermal ratings; Electric power system planning,Dynamic thermal rating; Power systems planning; Power transformer; Smart grid,"O.

In this context, methods based on the dissolved gas ratios allow to associate values of gas concentrations with the occurrence of some faults, such as partial discharges and thermal faults. So, an accurate prediction of oil-dissolved gas concentrations is a valuable tool to monitor the transformer condition and to develop a fault diagnosis system. This study proposes a nonlinear autoregressive neural network model coupled with the discrete wavelet transform for predicting transformer oil-dissolved gas concentrations.

Carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH2), ethane (C2H6), ethylene (C2H4) and acetylene (C2H2) were the analytes for the FT-IR spectrometer while propane (C3H8), propylene (C3H6), propyne (C3H4), n-butane (n-C4H10) and iso-butane (iso-C4H10) were the interferents, which might exist in the dissolved gas but are not currently used as analytes for detecting an internal fault. The instrument parameters and analysis approach are first introduced. Specifically, an absorption spectra reading approach by switching two cone-type gas cells into separate light-paths was presented for reducing the effects of gas in the gaps between gas cells and spectrometers, scanning the background spectrum without clearing the sample cell, and increasing the dynamics. Then, the instrument was tested with a standard gas mixture that was extracted from insulation oil in a power transformer. The testing results show that the detection limit of every analyte component is lower than 0.1 μL/L, and the detection limits of all analytes meet the detection requirements of oil-dissolved gas analysis, which means that the FT-IR spectrometer may be an ideal instrument due to its benefits, such as being maintenance-free and having a high stability. © 2018 by the authors.

Due to transformer regulation, variable loads can generate voltage profiles out of the acceptable bands recommended by grid codes, affecting the quality of service. At the same time, nonlinear loads, such as diode bridge rectifiers without power factor correction systems, generate nonlinear currents that affect the distribution transformer operation, reducing its lifetime. Variable loads can be commonly found at domiciliary levels due to the random operation of home appliances, but recently also due to electric vehicle charging stations, where the distribution transformer can cyclically vary between no-load, rated and overrated load. Thus, the distribution transformer can not safely operate under highly-dynamic and stressful conditions, requiring the support of alternative systems. Among the existing solutions, hybrid transformers, which are composed of a conventional transformer and a power converter, are an interesting alternative to cope with several power quality problems.

The widespread presence of distributed generation (DG) units reduces the loading passing through the distribution transformers and consequently improves the dynamic thermal failures. The system reliability is investigated for various penetrations of different scenarios from the view of DG technologies. The introduced method is applied to a realistic distribution system comprising different distribution transformers in Iran. The sensitivity analysis corresponding to adequacy indices such as expected energy not-supplied (EENS) based on DG penetrations is performed. By the use of the novel methodology proposed, it is possible to recognize how different DG technologies and penetrations can impact on the system reliability. The results demonstrate that the diesel generators and hybrid systems including diesel generators, photovoltaic units, and wind turbines are the most promising DG technologies to improve the transformer failures and the reliability of micro-grids compared with renewable DG units. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The solid component is a composite of cellulose, insulating oil and water nanoparticles. Measurements were made in the frequency range from 10−4 Hz to 5000 Hz at temperatures from 293.15 to 333.15 K. Uncertainty of temperature measurements was less than ±0.01 K. Pressboard impregnated with insulating oil with a water content of (5.0 ± 0.2) by weight moistened in a manner maximally similar to the moistening process in power transformers was investigated. It was found that there are two stages of changes in permittivity and imaginary permittivity components, occurring for low and high frequency. As the temperature increases, the frequency dependencies of the permittivity and imaginary permittivity component shifts to the higher frequency region. This phenomenon is related to the change of relaxation time with the increase in temperature. The values of relaxation time activation energies of the permittivity ∆Wτε′ ≈ (0.827 ± 0.0094) eV and the imaginary permittivity component ∆Wτε′′ = 0.883 eV were determined. It was found that Cole-Cole charts for the first stage are asymmetric and similar to those described by the Dawidson–Cole relaxation. For stage two, the charts are arc-shaped, corresponding to the Cole-Cole relaxation. It has been established that in the moistened pressboard impregnated with insulating oil, there is an additional polarization mechanism associated with the occurrence of water in the form of nanodrops and the tunneling of electrons between them. © 2021 by the authors.

Stringent government regulations alongside persistent pressure from environmental groups will further increase the demand and sales of such vehicles. This trend might put pressure on the grid and local power distribution circuits and transformers. A sudden increase in power consumption, mainly caused by people charging their vehicles at the same time, and during the already peak load on the utility, may cause problems. These problems are mainly caused by the heavy demand on the local voltage transformers and the power sources. Power generation and distribution utilities may need to incur significant cost increases if this problem is not handled appropriately. In this paper, we present a novel design and implementation logic for a smart grid system that allows for dynamic interaction between electric/PEVs and the power grid. This smart and dynamic interaction will allow for safe and semi-stable load on the grid and thus minimizing the cost and preventing damage caused by the excessive loads. The complete system design is presented in this paper with emphasis on the developed algorithms.

In this paper, an online monitor based on solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) detector is designed to address the poor stability, low sensitivity of other online-monitoring system. The system is composed of a gas measurement subsystem, a central controlling unit, and an intelligent fault diagnosis subsystem. A portable gas chromatography module developed using SOFC detector. The quantificational algorithm is derived, on basis of which calibration can be skipped. Due to the essential role of the chromatography column as well as gas the detector's temperature, proportional-integral-differential (PID) controller is implemented in the controlling unit. To evaluate the effectiveness of the developed online monitor, the quantitative analysis and engineering application have been performed; then, based on the measured results, the RVM-ANFIS algorithm is adopted to diagnosis the latent transformers faults. Using the developed online monitor, the results indicate that five characteristic gases, H2, CH4, C2H4, C2H6, and C2H2 can be measured accurately, and incipient faults can be detected, validate the effectiveness of this system. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Column chromatography; Energy conversion; Fault detection; Gas chromatography; Gases; Power transformers; Proportional control systems; Two term control systems; Chromatographic detectors; Condition assessments; Dissolved gas analyses (DGA); Intelligent fault diagnosis; On-line monitoring system; On-line monitors; Proportional integral differential controllers; Transformer condition assessment; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC),Condition assessment; Dissolved gas analysis (DGA); Online monitor; Power transformer; SOFC gas sensors,"Y.

Dissolved gas analysis (DGA) has shown great potential for detecting the incipient fault of oil-filled power transformers. In order to solve the misdiagnosis problems of traditional fault diagnosis approaches, a novel fault diagnosis method based on hypersphere multiclass support vector machine (HMSVM) and Dempster–Shafer (D–S) Evidence Theory (DET) is proposed. Firstly, proper gas dissolved in oil is selected as the fault characteristic of power transformers. Secondly, HMSVM is employed to diagnose transformer fault with selected characteristics. Then, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is utilized for parameter optimization. Finally, DET is introduced to fuse three different fault diagnosis methods together, including HMSVM, hybrid immune algorithm (HIA), and kernel extreme learning machine (KELM). To avoid the high conflict between different evidences, in this paper, a weight coefficient is introduced for the correction of fusion results. Results indicate that the fault diagnosis based on HMSVM has the highest probability to identify transformer faults among three artificial intelligent approaches. In addition, the improved D–S evidence theory (IDET) combines the advantages of each diagnosis method and promotes fault diagnosis accuracy. © 2019 by the authors.",Dissolution; Failure analysis; Gas chromatography; Machine learning; Oil filled transformers; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Power transformers; Support vector machines; Dissolved gas analyses (DGA); Dissolved gas analysis; Evidence theories; Extreme learning machine; Fault diagnosis method; HMSVM; Hybrid immune algorithms; Multi-class support vector machines; Fault detection,Dissolved gas analysis; D–S evidence theory; Fault diagnosis; HMSVM; Power transformer,"H.

Current ageing models are based on both, experimental evidence and theoretical developments; considering that all models are approximation to reality, loss of life estimation could be found in a large range depending on the evidence considered; this amplitude could lead inaccurate results to make adequate decisions in an asset-management context. These differences in results can be explained because the models consider only nominal operative temperatures ranges overlooking low and high temperatures degradation process and the influence of variations in paper moisture content. Considering the above, this document proposes a holistic methodology for solid insulation ageing assessing based on all thermal degradation process (oxidation, hydrolysis and pyrolysis) and the influence of dynamics on paper moisture. Paper moisture is estimated using as input external variables such as: load, ambient temperature, transformer technical data and measurements regarding oil moisture, in order to consider uncertain in oil moisture growing Arithmetic-Brownian-Motion algorithms are presented. The proposed methodology was tested for four power transformers, for which load and ambient temperature hourly profiles are available over a period of almost nine years. In order to compare different degradation rates, three alternatives to model the chemical environment in which cellulose is aged, are analysed.

One of these techniques is the modification of existing mineral oils by the addition of different types of nanoparticles in various concentrations. These types of materials, suspensions of nanoparticles called nanofluids, have found numerous applications in the energy industry, especially in heat exchanger systems and solar cells. Much research has been done on attempts to replace mineral oils (MO), which are harmful for the environment, with natural ester oils (NE), but to make this possible, it is necessary to improve the insulating properties of these oils, for example by adding nanoparticles. This paper presents an extensive overview of the insulating properties; including for AC, DC and the lightning impulse breakdown voltage; for both mineral and natural ester oils containing various type of nanoparticles (NP).

For this purpose, four antennas specially adapted to be installed in the transformer tank (UHF disk sensor, UHF drain valve sensor, planar inverted F-type antenna, Hilbert curve fractal antenna) and a reference log-periodic antenna were used in laboratory tests. During the research, the main types of PD, typical for oil-paper insulation, were generated, i.e., PD in oil, PD in oil wedge, PD in gas bubbles, surface discharges, and creeping sparks. For the registered UHF PD pulses, nine features in the frequency domain and four features in the wavelet domain were extracted. Then, the PD classification process was carried out with the use of selected methods of supervised machine learning. The study investigated the influence of the number and type of feature on the obtained classification results gained with the following machine-learning methods: decision tree, support vector machine, Bayes method, k-nearest neighbor, linear discriminant, and ensemble machine. As a result of the works carried out, it was found that the highest accuracies are gathered for the feature representing peak frequency using a decision tree, reaching values, depending on the type of antenna, from 89.7% to 100%, with an average of 96.8%. In addition, it was found that the MRMR method reduces the number of features from 13 to 1 while maintaining very high effectiveness. The broadband log-periodic antenna ensured the highest average efficiency (100%) in the PD classification. In the case of the tested antennas adapted to work in an energy transformer tank, the highest defect-recognition efficiency is provided by the UHF disk sensor (99.3%), and the lowest (89.7%) is by the UHF drain valve sensor. © 2022 by the authors.

Placing a sensor in an area with many obstructions may lead to a decrease in sensitivity to the UHF signals. In this contribution, a previously validated simulation model of a three-phase 300 MVA, 420 kV power transformer is used to perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the most sensitive sensor positions on the tank wall when PD activity occurs inside the windings. A matrix of UHF sensors located on the transformer tank is used to perform the sensitivity analysis. Some of the windings are designed as layer windings, thus preventing the UHF signals from traveling through them and creating a realistic situation with very indirect propagation from source to sensor. Based on these findings, sensor configurations optimized for UHF signal sensitivity, which is also required for PD source localization, are recommended for localization purposes. Additionally, the propagation and attenuation of the UHF signals inside the windings and the tank are discussed in both oil and air. © 2020 by the authors.",Acceptance tests; Electric transformer testing; Electromagnetic simulation; High frequency transformers; Monitoring; Palladium; Partial discharges; Power transformers; Tanks (containers); Transformer windings; UHF devices; Underwater acoustics; Winding; Continuous monitoring; Partial discharge measurements; Sensitivity evaluation; Sensor configurations; Sensor positioning; Source localization; Transformer tanks; Ultra-high frequency; Sensitivity analysis,Acceptance tests; Monitoring; Partial discharge; PD; PD sensors; Power transformers; Sensitivity evaluation; Sensor positioning; UHF,"C.

However, when using SVM, it is easy to misclassify samples which are located near the decision boundary, resulting in a decrease in the accuracy of fault diagnosis. Given this issue, this paper proposed a genetic algorithm (GA) optimized probabilistic SVM (GAPSVM) integrated with the fuzzy three-ratio (FTR) method, in which the GAPSVM can judge whether a sample is near the decision boundary according to its output probabilities and diagnose the samples which are not near the decision boundary. Then, FTR is used to diagnose the samples which are near the decision boundary. Combining GAPSVM and FTR, the integrated model can accurately diagnose samples near the decision boundary of SVM. In addition, to avoid redundant and erroneous features, this paper also used GA to select the optimal DGA features. The diagnostic accuracy of the proposed GAPSVM integrated with the FTR fault diagnosis method reached 86.80% after 10 repeated calculations using 118 groups of IEC technical committee (TC) 10 samples. Moreover, the robustness is also proven through 30 groups of DGA samples from the State Grid Co. of China and 15 practical cases with missing values. © 2020 by the authors.

With the continued need for power transformers, the use and reuse of mineral oil in transformers has reached several thousand tonnes across the world. Therefore, industries are compelled to resolve the problem of pollution and non-biodegradability of petroleum-based mineral oil. Typically, there is no right solution; to that end researchers have recently shifted their focus towards edible oil markets to find the alternative insulating fluid. Although edible oils are a better choice over mineral oil, they still exhibit several detrimental properties as with mineral oil. The purpose of this survey is to contrast mineral oil-based transformer oils in the power industry and its alternatives. The review makes use of several research articles over a period of 32 years, covering and uncovering the facts on mineral oil, silicone oil and natural esters. In this view, the technology utilisation, efficiency improvement and inferences are accessible for current and future authors to select the right technology for the development of new insulating fluid. © 2020 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l.-All rights reserved.",,Ageing; Bio-Degradability; Kraft Paper; Mineral Oil; Natural Ester,,,Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l,22815295,,,,English,Int.

A thermal diagram as shown in the IEC 60076-2:2011 standard specified a hot spot factor method to estimate the hot spot temperature based on heat run test data. The hot spot factor is split into a Q factor, which depends on loss distribution within winding, and an S factor, which depends on oil flow distribution within winding cooling ducts. In this paper, an experiment is conducted on a disc type winding model to study the hot spot factor under fixed winding geometries subjected to wide range of inlet flow rates and uniform or non-uniform power loss injections. The hot spot factor is calculated from measured temperatures within the winding model using thermocouples. The hot spot factor was decoupled by applying first uniform losses to calculate the S factor and then nonuniform losses to calculate the Q factor. It was observed that the hot spot factor is lower for more uniform temperature profiles. It was observed that the S and Q factors are interdependent and cannot be decoupled. © 2016 IEEE.",Experiments; Oil filled transformers; Power transformers; Q factor measurement; Thermocouples; Winding; Experimental investigations; Hot spot; Hotspot temperature; Measured temperatures; Oil immersed power transformer; Thermal modelling; Transformer; Uniform temperature; Condition monitoring,Experiment; Hot Spot; Thermal modelling; Transformer,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-150903398-0,,,English,CMD - Int.

Its working state is closely related to the reliable operation of power transformers. To overcome the electromagnetic interference and security risks during sensor installation, a Sagnac interference optical technique for partial discharge (PD) detection is proposed in this paper. By establishing a simulation model of the sensing structure, it is verified that output signal amplitude varies periodically with the length of sensing and delay fibers. Moreover, the output value decreases with increasing probe radius. The results show that a delay fiber of 1.5 km, a sensing fiber of 3 m, and a bending radius of 5 mm are optimal parameter combinations to detect PD in a 72.5 kV defective bushing. In addition, consistent detection waveforms induced by both internal and external defects are obtained by the optical sensor and high frequency current transformer (HFCT) simultaneously, then the effectiveness of the optical sensor on detecting PD signals for bushing is verified. It is of great help to carry out online monitoring of bushing insulation defects through optical non-destructive installation.  © 1986-2012 IEEE.",Bushings; Electromagnetic pulse; Fiber optic sensors; High frequency transformers; Optical fibers; Power transformers; -bushing; Insulator; Optical reflection; Optical-; Partial discharge; Partial discharge detection; Sagnac; Sagnac interferometer; Sensitivity; Partial discharges,Bushing; optical sensor; partial discharge (PD); sagnac; sensitivity,"J.

This paper presents some analysis into the effect of current harmonics on the maximum loading capability of oil-filled transformers that are intended to operate within solar power plants.

The rate and location of adoption of these technologies on residential distribution systems introduce operational uncertainties for which traditional utilities may not be prepared. This paper proposes a user-defined, data-driven risk assessment method to quantify the severity and likelihood of transformer and secondary conductor overload conditions posed by high levels of EV charging demand coupled with rooftop solar PV. The stochasticity inherent in the operation of a distribution secondary system is captured by employing data-driven probability distribution functions for residential loading, EV charging, rooftop solar generation and ambient temperature. Samples then are repeatedly drawn from each function as inputs to a Monte-Carlo, multi-period power flow analysis to calculate secondary line currents, total loading and accelerated transformer aging. The proposed approach is utilized to study transformer and secondary conductor overload risk as well as transformer loss-of-life for multiple EV and PV penetration scenarios using historical EV charging profiles and residential Salt Lake City load profile data for a peak summer load day. © 2010 IEEE.",Electric automobiles; Electric load flow; Housing; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Solar power generation; Distribution systems; Overload condition; Power flow analysis; Residential distribution systems; Risk assessment methods; Secondary conductor; Solar photovoltaics; Transformer loss of lives; Distribution functions,Data-driven approach; Distribution systems; Electric vehicle; Monte carlo simulation; Probabilistic modeling,"A.

Majority of these faults are of progressive nature and should be rectified as soon as they emerge. Frequency response analysis (FRA) has been widely accepted as a reliable diagnostic tool to detect such faults. As reliable interpretation codes for FRA signatures have not been fully developed and accepted yet, researchers have put much effort to investigate the impact of various mechanical deformations on the transformer FRA signature. Because of the intrusive nature of such faults when staged on a real transformer, most of the studies in the literatures were conducted on a transformer high frequency electric circuit model. Simplifications assumed in these models by ignoring the turn-to-turn capacitance, not taking into account the detailed winding structure and not considering all mutual inductances between coils in various phases have reduced the accuracy of the obtained results. To establish reliable FRA interpretation codes, it is essential to develop electric equivalent circuit models that can yield FRA signature as close as possible to the FRA signature trend of the real transformer. This paper proposes a detailed transformer high frequency electric circuit model which considers the winding structure, inter-turn capacitance and all mutual inductances. Calculation details of the model's parameters are presented.

Fundamental components in this grid infrastructure are transformers, which are designed conservatively based on static rated power. However, load and weather change continuously and hence, transformers are not used most efficiently. For this reason, new technology has been developed: Dynamic transformer rating (DTR). Applying DTR makes it possible to load transformers above the nameplate rating without affecting their lifetime expectancy. This study uses DTR for short-term and long-term wind farm planning. The optimal wind farm is designed by applying DTR to the power transformer and using it as an input to a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model. Regarding the transformer thermal analysis, the linearized top oil model of IEEE Clause 7 is selected. The model is executed for 4 different types of power transformers: 63 MVA, 100 MVA, 200 MVA and 400 MVA. As a result, it is obtained that the net present value for the investment and the capacity of the wind farm increase linearly with respect to the size of the transformer. Then, a sensitivity analysis is carried out by modifying the wind speed, the electricity price, the lifetime of the transformer and the selected weather data. From this sensitivity analysis, it is possible to conclude that wind resources and electricity price are critical parameters for the wind farm's feasibility. © 2021 The Author(s)",Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Integer programming; Investments; Oil filled transformers; Power transformers; Sensitivity analysis; Thermoanalysis; Wind; Dynamic transformer rating; Electricity prices; Grid infrastructures; Optimal sizing; Planning of power system; Power; Renewable generation; Transformer ratings; Wind energy integration; Wind farm; Wind power,Dynamic transformer rating; Planning of power systems; Renewable generation; Wind energy integration,"K.

The risk of failure is calculated by measuring the useful life of the transformer and the presence of dissolved gases. The useful life is estimated by means of the Arrhenius model of thermal damage, while incipient faults can be detected by dissolved gas analysis. The risk of transformer failure is estimated by examining the data cited above, on the basis of information theory concepts. It is formulated as a multiperiod optimization problem with linear objectives and nonlinear constraints and restricted to the risk of accepting transformer overloads.

However, transformer loading is affected by several factors that should be considered, among which the thermal stress is recognized as the most influencing one. In this context, the dynamic thermal rating concept is of great interest and it allows fixing the maximum allowable current in different operating conditions, still maintaining acceptable risk levels based on the consequences of loading the transformers beyond the nameplate ratings. A probabilistic procedure for managing the delivery of power to load by the dynamic transformer rating is presented in this paper. The procedure is based on the risk analysis related to the thermal stress introduced by the transformer (over)load, which determines loss of life and potential dielectric failure. Numerical experiments based on actual data are performed for several scenarios, and several cases are presented to support the procedure for the intelligent exploitation of the potentialities of transformers. © 2020 IEEE.",Electric power transmission; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Thermal stress; Acceptable risk levels; Different operating conditions; Dynamic thermal ratings; Intelligent operations; Numerical experiments; Probabilistic managements; Transformer loadings; Transformer ratings; Stress analysis,dynamic transformer rating; energy management; load forecasting; probabilistic forecasting; risk analysis,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-172812822-1,,,English,"Int.

This paper presents an approach based on statistical indices and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods to interpret frequency responses. The proposed procedure divides frequency responses into four frequency regions based on frequency resonances and antiresonances. Then, Lin’s Concordance Coefficient (LCC) index is used as one of the most appropriate numerical indices to extract features of the four frequency regions. Finally, the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network is trained by the extracted features to identify and differentiate the types of winding faults. Besides, other intelligent algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), and Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network have been employed to compare the classification results. The proposed techniques have been practically implemented. The Axial Displacement (AD) and Disk Space Variation (DSV) faults are applied as two common mechanical faults in different locations and intensities on the 20kV windings of a 1.6MVA distribution power transformer and their corresponding frequency responses are calculated. Frequency responses calculated from the AD and DSV faults constitute the MLP input data set. The network is trained with part of the input data, and the rest of the data is allocated to validate and test the network. The results show that the suggested method has more proper performance than others using the phase component of the frequency responses in interpreting frequency responses and separation and identifying various mechanical fault types of transformer windings. © 2023 University of Mohaghegh Ardabili.

The traditional transformer fault diagnostic methods based on dissolved gas analysis are limited due to the low accuracy of fault identification. In this study, an effective transformer fault diagnosis system is proposed to improve identification accuracy. The proposed approach combines an improved genetic algorithm (IGA) with the XGBoost to form a hybrid diagnosis network. The combination of the improved genetic algorithm and the XGBoost (IGA-XGBoost) forms the basic unit of the proposed method, which decomposes and reconstructs the transformer fault recognition problem into several minor problems IGA-XGBoosts can solve. The results of simulation experiments show that the IGA performs excellently in the combined optimization of input feature selection and the XGBoost parameter, and the proposed method can accurately identify the transformer fault types with an average accuracy of 99.2%. Compared to IEC ratios, dual triangle, support vector machine and common vector approach the diagnostic accuracy of the proposed method is improved by 30.2, 47.2, 11.2, and 3.6%, respectively.

In the course of the tests, the insulation samples were subjected to a process of accelerated thermal degradation of cellulose macromolecules, as well as weight-controlled dampening, thereby simulating the ageing processes occurring when using the insulation in power transformers. The effects of temperature in the ranges typical of normal transformer operation were also taken into account. On the basis of the obtained data, the activation energy was then fixed together with dominant time constants of cellulose–aramid insulation relaxation processes with respect to the temperature and degree of moisture, as well as thermal degradation of cellulose macromolecules. It was found that the greatest and predictable changes in the activation energy value were caused by the temperature and the degree of moisture in the samples. A similar conclusion applies to the dominant time constant of the relaxation process of cellulose fibers. Degree of thermal degradation samples was of marginal importance for the described parameters. The final outcome of the test results and analyses presented in the article are regression functions for the activation energy and the dominant time constants depending on the earlier listed parameters of the experiment, which may be used in the future diagnostics of the degree of technical wear of cellulose–aramid insulation performed using the PDC method. © 2020 by the authors.",Activation Energy; Cellulose; Depolarization; Macromolecules; Moisture; Temperature; Activation energy; Cellulose; Depolarization; Electric transformer testing; Macromolecules; Mineral oils; Moisture; Polarization; Power transformers; Relaxation processes; Temperature; Accelerated thermal degradation; Analysis of polarizations; Aramid insulation; Cellulose macromolecules; Effects of temperature; Laboratory test; Polarization and depolarization currents; Regression function; Thermal insulation,Activation energy; Ageing effect; Cellulose–aramid paper; Dielectric polarization; Moisture insulation; Power transformer insulation testing; Relaxation methods,"S.

The uncertainty of temperature maintenance during measurements was below ±0.01 K. The sample was prepared for testing in a manner as close as possible to the cellulose insulation moisturizing process in power transformers. For the analysis of the results obtained, a model of alternating and direct current hopping conductivity was used, based on the quantum phenomenon of electron tunneling between the potential wells and nanodrops of water. It was observed that on the d(logσ)/d(logf)-derived waveforms there was a clear low-frequency maximum, and a tendency to reach the next maximum in the high-frequency area was visible. On this basis it was established that the increase in conductivity takes place in two stages. It was found that the position of σ(f) waveforms in the double logarithmic coordinates is influenced by the temperature dependence both of the conductivity and of the relaxation time of the conductivity. These relationships are described with the appropriate activation energies of the conductivity and relaxation time of conductivity. Based on the analysis of experimental data using Arrhenius diagrams, average values of the activation energy of conductivity ∆Wσ ≈ (0.894 ± 0.0134) eV and the relaxation time of conductivity ∆Wτσ ≈ (0.869 ± 0.0107) eV were determined. The values were equal within the limits of uncertainty and their mean value was ∆W ≈ (0.881 ± 0.0140) eV. Using the mean value of the activation energy, the frequency dependence of conductivity, obtained at different temperatures, was shifted to 293.15 K. For this purpose, first the waveforms were shifted along the horizontal and then the vertical axis. It was found that after the shift the σ(f) waveforms for the different temperatures overlap perfectly. This means that the shape of the frequency dependence of the conductivity is determined by the moisture content of the pressboard. The position of the waveforms in relation to the coordinates is determined by the temperature relationships of the conductivity and the relaxation time of the conductivity. © 2020 by the authors.

The composite consisted of heavily moistered oil-impregnated pressboard. The moisturization of the pressboard occurred in a manner as close as possible to the process of wetting the insulation in power transformers to a moisture content of (5.0 ± 0.2) wt. %. This value of moisture content was chosen because exceeding this value can lead to transformer failure. The measuring temperature range was from 293.15 K (20◦C) to 333.15 K (60◦C), with a step of 8 K. The measuring frequency range was 0.0001 Hz to 5000 Hz. It was observed that the shape of the frequency dependence of the loss angle tangent for a moisture content of 5.0 wt. % does not depend on the value of the measuring temperature. An increase in temperature leads to a shift of the waveforms into the higher frequency region. This is associated with a decrease in the relaxation time, and its value depends on the activation energy. It was found that a good fit of the waveforms, simulated by Dirana, to the actual tgδ waveforms obtained at temperatures between 293.15 K (20◦C) and 333.15 K (60◦C) requires the introduction of temperatures, higher than the actual insulation temperatures, into the program. It was found that estimating the moisture content for different temperatures using Dirana soft-ware for insulating an oil-impregnated pressboard produced large discrepancies from the actual content. Better results were obtained after an adjustment requiring manual temperature correction towards higher, compared to measured, temperatures. The moisture content estimated after correction by the Dirana meter ranges from of 4.5 wt. % to 5.7 wt. % and increases almost linearly with increasing measuring temperature. The average moisture content estimated by the Dirana meter for all measuring temperatures is 5.1 wt. % and is close to the actual content (5.0 ± 0.2) wt. %. The uncertainty of the estimate is ±0.43 wt. % and is more than twice as high as the true value. © 2022 by the authors.

Pressboard was moistened to a water content of (5.0 ± 0.2) wt.% The loss tangent was measured using a DIRANA meter (FDS-PDC dielectric response analyzer) in the frequency range 10-4 Hz–5000 Hz for 6 temperatures from 293.15 K to 333.15 K with a step of 8 K. The waveforms simulated by the DIRANA software were fitted to the experimental dependence of the loss tangent. The fitting process was performed using two methods. In the first method, the measuring temperature value as well as X and Y values were entered into the software. The estimated moisture content of the insulation varied from about 1.4 to about 5.2 wt.%. The average value of moisture content was (3.73 ± 1.11) wt.%. In the second method, only the measuring temperature value was entered into the software. This improved the quality of matching. The estimated average moisture content was (5.83 ± 0.25) wt.%. It was found that the dimensions of the oil channel clearly affected the quality of the fitting process. By not taking into consideration real values of oil channel, the quality of the moisture content estimation was significantly improved. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Top manufacturers of power electrics develop and adopt online monitoring systems. Such systems become part of high-voltage grid and unit transformers. However, furnace transformers are a broad category that this change does not affect yet. At the same time, adoption of diagnostic systems for furnace transformers is relevant because they are a heavy-duty application with no redundancy. Creating any such system requires a well-founded mathematical analysis of the facility’s condition, carefully selected diagnostic parameters, and setpoints thereof, which serve as the condition categories. The goal hereof was to create an expert system to detect insulation breach and its expansion as well as to evaluate the risk it poses to the system; the core mechanism is mathematical processing of trends in partial discharge (PD). We ran tests on a 26-MVA transformer installed on a ladle furnace at a steelworks facility. The transformer is equipped with a versatile condition monitoring system that continually measures apparent charge and PD intensity. The objective is to identify the condition of the transformer and label it with one of the generally recognized categories: Normal, Poor, Critical. The contribution of this paper consists of the first ever validation of a single generalized metric that describes the condition of transformer insulation based on the online monitoring of the PD parameters. Fuzzy logic algorithms are used in mathematical processing. The proposal is to generalize the set of diagnostic variables to a single deterministic parameter: Insulation state indicator. The paper provides an example of calculating it from the apparent charge and PD power readings. To measure the indicativeness of individual parameters for predicting further development of a defect, the authors developed a method for testing the diagnostic sensitivity of these parameters to changes in the condition. The method was tested using trends in readings sampled whilst the status was degrading from Normal to Critical. The paper also shows a practical example of defect localization. The recommendation is to broadly use the method in expert systems for high-voltage equipment monitoring. © 2022 by the authors.

The insulation liquid impregnates the solid-covering air spaces, which improves the efficiency of the insulation system. Not only does the oil ensure electrical insulation but it also works as coolants transferring the heat generated during transformer operation to the exterior of the transformer. Throughout normal operation conditions, transformers experience multiple stresses that degrade their insulation. Since the lifetime of oil-immersed transformers is defined mainly by the state of the insulation paper, it is critical to understand the behavior and degradation mechanisms of new insulation systems that try to overcome the drawbacks of mineral oil as well as to improve power transformer performances. The current increased prevalence of the nonlinear loads additionally stresses power transformers, which generates their premature ageing or even failure. Consequently, new materials and assessment methods are required to guarantee the suitable management of power transformer populations.

The importance of the transformer is increasing more and more due to an increase in voltage level. For the safe and stable operation of the whole system, the transformer must operate properly. The service life expectancy of a transformer depends on the insulating oil of the transformer. The transformer insulating oil acts as an excellent insulating medium as well as a cooling medium. Insulating oil in the transformer prevents the flow of electric current between different potential points. Therefore it is important to check the insulation levels and nature of transformer oil to forbid catastrophic damage in the whole system. In this paper, several methods practised evaluating the properties of transformer oil to maintain the quality of the transformer has been discussed. The alternative of mineral oil, which is biodegradable has also been discussed in the study. © 2020 IEEE.",Dielectric liquids; Electric currents; Electric power transmission; Insulation; Power transformers; Catastrophic damage; Distribution transformer; Electrical power; Insulation level; Life expectancies; Power system networks; Stable operation; Transmission and distribution; Oil filled transformers,Dielectric Breakdown; Insulating Oil; Mineral oil; Partial Discharge(Pd); Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB),,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-172816746-6,,,English,"IEEE PES/IAS PowerAfrica, PowerAfrica",Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85095111740

In addition, in order to verify the simulation model, the tests for transformer temperature rise test were performed. The results show that, compared with the unstructured mesh, polyhedral mesh can greatly reduce the number of cells in the same basic size, which is 1/3 of tetrahedral mesh. The convergence time and the occupied computer memory are 1/9 and 1/2 of the tetrahedral mesh, respectively.

The proposed method and the developed measuring system are based on the use of a capacitive probe, thanks to which the high voltage measurement is safe (galvanic separation from the objects at ahigh potential). It is also flexible because the voltage ratio of this system can be configured in a wide range by changing the probe’s position. The proposed solution makes the portable PD monitoring system fully autonomous and independent of the substation systems and devices. The article presents both the concept of the non-contact HV measurement system and its practical implementation. The procedure for determining the voltage ratio and measurement uncertainty, which is at an acceptable level of 1–5% in laboratory conditions, was discussed in detail. In addition, the article discusses the digital filtering and wavelet de-noising methods implemented in the software of the monitoring system, which makes it possible to measure the voltage in the presence of strong electromagnetic disturbances occurring at the substation.

Through criteria such as the parallelism index developed for this work, it is possible to identify the percentage of the load that is assured by a transformer in parallel at the moment of a contingency. The operational condition representing the physical situation of the power transformer, typically found in the literature as health index. It assesses factors such as deterioration of the cellulose paper that makes up the insulation and oil, age of the equipment and loading factor, resulting in a life expectancy for the power transformer. The operational vulnerability indicator can be used as an important guide for the strategic planning of the resource application of electric power companies. The methodology is verified through a case study involving real data from 7 substations and 39 power transformers, belonging to a Brazilian electricity company. In the validation of the method, the effectiveness of the proposed method is compared with the ranking obtained through the traditional health index. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Criteria; Electric Utilities; Health; Paper; Transformers; Vulnerability; Work; Electric power generation; Electric substations; Electric utilities; Health; Oil filled transformers; Electric power company; Electricity companies; Health indices; Operational conditions; Operational vulnerabilities; Parallelism index; PROMETHEE; Technical conditions; Power transformers,Health index; Parallelism index; Power transformers substitution; PROMETHEE; Substations,"W.I.

This study uses dynamic rating on medium power transformer in the regional grid. The 63 MVA transformer is used for connecting the wind farm to the grid in Körsbärsdalen.The power system analysis evaluates how dynamic transformer rating (DTR) and increased share of wind power affect the grid performance with respect to reliability, voltage stability and active power losses. The actual rating has exceeded nominal capacity throughout the year, with larger margins during the winter. Rate of transformer lifetime is used as an input for economical analysis, with a trade-off between reliability and revenue from increased capacity and cheaper dispatch.Through the power system analysis procedure presented further, it is possible to sort out the most probable faults to cause severe violations. The fault probability is used for efficient reinforcement of the grid. The contingency and reliability analysis can help find the solutions that will decrease the probability of violations most efficiently. Furthermore, the developed procedure can also be used when expanding the grid and determining which grid alternative will be most reliable. © 2021 IEEE.",Economic and social effects; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Power transformers; Reliability analysis; Systems analysis; Wind power; Active power loss; Dynamic ratings; Economical analysis; Fault probabilities; Grid performance; Nominal capacities; Power system analysis; Transformer ratings; Electric power system interconnection,dynamic transformer rating; power system reliability; power transformer,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-166543597-0,,,English,"IEEE Madrid PowerTech, PowerTech - Conf.

The innovation of this paper can be shown by introducing a new method of data optimization based on the combination (subsets) of the set (C-set) method and the unsupervised fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering algorithm. The new method aims to solve the quandaries of unbalanced data, outliers, and boundary ratios that exist in conventional and artificial methods. Considering the compactness of dissolved gas analysis (DGA) data, the C-set method is employed for dividing the data samples according to their fault types into multiple groups without repetition. The FCM algorithm is then adopted for the samples pre-selection process by obtaining the cluster centers of each C-set class. The obtained cluster centers are combined to form the labeled expert training data (LETD) set, which will train the 1-vs-1 multiclass support vector machine (MCSVM) with a linear kernel. The proposed model diagnosis obtained accuracy is 88.9%. Our proposed model has been compared with other soft computing and traditional models.

Periodic examinations for detecting and locating trivial deformation occurrences are indispensable for preventing their unexpected outage and costly, time-consuming repair procedure. The most crucial step for fault detection is obtaining parameters of the detailed model.

This causes these transformers to be prone to damages due to an extreme increase in their temperature. Such condition could be ameliorated by placing temperature sensor inside each transformer which is unfortunately not physically realizable. Hence, an alternate method is needed to perform the temperature monitoring function. This paper presents a proposed temperature sensor using an electronic device that models the internal temperature of a transformer without installing temperature sensor inside the transformer. The electronic device performs the temperature sensing function by modeling the temperature using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in conjunction with measured power quality parameters on the secondary side of the transformer and the temperature on the outside of the transformer as measured by infrared sensors. Hardware implementation using the ARM STM32F4 embedded controller demonstrates the ability of the proposed device in producing accurate Intelligent Electronic Device (IED) which can further be developed to provide early online notification when a disturbance occurs. © 2019 IEEE.",Electron devices; Infrared detectors; Neural networks; Power quality; Temperature sensors; Thermoelectric equipment; Distribution transformer; Embedded controllers; Hardware implementations; Intelligent electronic device; Internal temperature; Power quality parameters; Temperature monitoring; Temperature sensing; Oil filled transformers,ANN; embedded controller; IED; power quality; transformer oil,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-172815692-7,,,English,"Int.

However, they are general approaches in terms of power transformers. Some only focus on applying a specific class of techniques, but again, for general power transformers. Other reviews focus on applying different technologies such as fiber optics, thermal cameras, and vibration sensors, but all within the perspective of general power transformers. A significant question remains: among all types of power transformers, which specific techniques should be used, and why are they more adequate? What are the uncertainties that can decrease their precision? What about the balance, in terms of costs, associated with applying a certain technique and the return needed for a particular type of transformer? In this context, this paper is not only a literature review of well-known problems related to power transformers. Here, we do not just center on large power transformers (100 MVA or higher). Still, we describe a case study of a phase-shifting 1400 MVA-400 kV three-phase transformer that currently connects two European countries that began to show signs of abnormal operating conditions in 2012. In this way, the need to detect and identify anomalies in their initial stage of development for a possible preventive maintenance action is more than justified, which is essentially achieved with continuous monitoring models of the transformer, as concluded in this paper. © 2022, MDPI.

Motivated by the shortage of deterministic data regarding to the power demand required by EV charging in Brazil, a probabilistic methodology is proposed to estimate this impact. For that, energy consumption and urban mobility patterns from a pilot region are used to compose the distribution transformer load curve. Both energy consumption for EVs and typical consumer demand take into account the probabilistic nature of load. Therefore, the Monte Carlo method applies for both situations, Base Scenario and EV Scenario. From the union of both scenarios, the load curve of the distribution transformer is evaluated regarding to the influence of different EV penetration levels. The results can be used by energy distributors as a support tool for the decision to prioritize the investments in distribution transformers. © 2018 IEEE.",Charging (batteries); Decision support systems; Electric automobiles; Electric transformer loads; Electric transformers; Electric vehicles; Energy utilization; Investments; Monte Carlo methods; Decision supports; Distribution systems; Distribution transformer; Electric vehicle charging; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Load curves; Probabilistic methodology; Urban mobility patterns; Electric load distribution,Decision Support; Distribution Transformer; Electric Vehicle; Load Curve; Monte Carlo Method.,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-153865844-4,,,English,"Proc.

The maintenance of this key equipment is highly important which can be done with different techniques such as thermal and vibration analysis, frequency analysis using wavelet transform and dissolved gas analysis. The application of predictive maintenance of the power transformer represents an important feature of the Smart Energy Management System in micro grids, that can reduce the percentage of failure occurrence while increasing the availability of the power transformer and prevents blackouts. This paper represents different failure classification techniques based on dissolved gas analysis data mainly logistic regression, multiclass jungle, multiclass decision tree and artificial neural network. The application can diagnosis the power transformer failures based on the parts-per-million of the different gas generated in the oil. The results of applying different types of classification algorithms shows the best technique to be part of a bigger system of monitoring and diagnostic of different installed equipment in a micro grid. The implementation of such application in real time energy management system requires different type of sensors and the interaction of offline database, the paper also shows the steps to integrate the algorithm in the Smart Energy Management System.  © 2022 IEEE.",Classification (of information); Decision trees; Electric power transmission networks; Energy dissipation; Energy management; Energy management systems; Failure (mechanical); Information management; Machine learning; Neural networks; Oil filled transformers; Outages; Smart power grids; Vibration analysis; Wavelet transforms; Classification technique; Dissolved gases analysis; Failure classification; Failures prediction; Machine-learning; Microgrid; Oil-immersed power transformers; Smart energies; Smart grid; Transformer failure; Power transformers,Classification; Energy Management; Machine Learning; Power Transformer; Prediction; Smart Grid,,Benhala B.; Mansouri K.; Raihani A.; Qbadou M.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-166542209-3,,,English,"Int.

They are expensive apparatuses accounting for a significant portion of the capital investment in the electric power system. Several monitoring systems and diagnostic approaches have been developed over the last few decades with the common goal of increasing the operating life of power transformers and reducing the possibility of catastrophic failures. However, some challenges need to be addressed before effectively interpreting measurement data gathered from these techniques and making specific judgments about the transformer condition. Machine learning (ML) as a principal class of artificial intelligence (AI) is a suitable solution to this problem, and it has recently intrigued the interest of many researchers. In this regard, the present paper reviews the literature and analyzes the latest techniques included while highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of current methodologies. Also, intelligent fault diagnosis methods and the most widely used intelligent algorithms in evaluating the condition of transformers are presented. The methods discussed in this paper are useful for diagnosing both power and distribution transformers. Finally, potential solutions are proposed, and future research directions are suggested. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Condition monitoring; Electric power systems; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Investments; Machine learning; Assets management; Capital investment; Condition; Critical component; Intelligent fault diagnosis; Machine-learning; Monitoring system; Power; Transformer asset management; Transformer failure; Power transformers,Condition monitoring; Intelligent fault diagnosis; Machine learning; Transformer asset management; Transformer failures,"M.H.

The interpretation of FRA can be achieved by the conventional mathematical indicators-based method, which is mostly used in the past. The newly developing artificial intelligence (AI)-based method also provides an alternative interpretation. However, in most reported AI techniques, the features of FRA signatures are directly input into the AI model to obtain the classification results. Few studies have concentrated on the separability of winding deformation faults. In this context, a spectral clustering algorithm is studied to aid in FRA interpretation.

The proposed BDD consists of the following three key points. First, to overcome an important issue that most DGA data found in real-world industrial settings is unlabeled, Duval's method is newly used to provide knowledge, which is called pseudo-labeling information, to a DNN for unlabeled DGA data. Second, motivated by the fact that the pseudo-labeled data does not always declare correct answers, a DNN architecture with an auxiliary regularization task is newly proposed, which is somewhat robust to the noisy labeled data. Last, a parameter transfer learning approach is applied to evolve the pre-trained DNN model, which is trained from a large amount of pseudo-labeled source DGA data, for diagnosing the sparse labeled target DGA data. Four case studies are executed through the use of KEPCO's massive unlabeled DGA data and IEC TC 10′s sparse labeled DGA data: (i) a comparison with the existing methods, (ii) examination of the effectiveness of parameter freezing via feature space investigation, (iii) studying the robustness of the regularization task under noisy labeled DGA, and (iv) probing the hyperparameter effects. Moreover, to strengthen the proposed model's effectiveness, the last fifth case study performs a comparison with the existing methods for KEPCO's sparse labeled data instead of IEC TC 10 data. We confirm that the proposed BDD method outperforms existing methods, thanks to the Duval method's weak supervision, the regularization task, and parameter transfer. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Deep neural networks; Fault detection; Power transformers; Case-studies; Dissolved gases analysis; Faults diagnosis; Keypoints; Labeled data; Parameter transfers; Power transformer fault diagnosis; Regularisation; Rule based; Teachers'; Failure analysis,Deep neural network; Dissolved gas analysis; Fault diagnosis; Power transformer,"S.-H.

However, due to the complexity and diversity of fault types, the traditional modeling method based on oil sample analysis is struggling to meet the industrial demand for diagnostic accuracy. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a probabilistic neural network (PNN)-based fault diagnosis model for power transformers and optimizes the smoothing factor of the pattern layer of PNN by the improved gray wolf optimizer (IGWO) to improve the classification accuracy and robustness of PNN. The standard GWO easily falls into the local optimum because the update mechanism is too single. The update strategy proposed in this paper enhances the convergence ability and exploration ability of the algorithm, which greatly alleviates the dilemma that GWO is prone to fall into local optimum when dealing with complex data. In this paper, a reliability analysis of thirteen diagnostic methods is conducted using 555 transformer fault samples collected from Jiangxi Power Supply Company, China. The results show that the diagnostic accuracy of the IGWO-PNN model reaches 99.71%, which is much higher than that of the traditional IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) three-ratio method. Compared with other neural network models, IGWO-PNN also has higher diagnostic accuracy and stability, and is more applicable to the field of transformer fault diagnosis. © 2021 by the authors.

The main biodegradable fluids used are natural and synthetic esters, although biodegradable hydrocarbons have been recently proposed. Biodegradable fluids have a much lower environmental impact than mineral oil, limiting the risk of soil contamination in leaks, which makes them a suitable solution for applications such as offshore transformers or railway transformers. Additionally, these fluids have a higher flash point than conventional mineral oils, which dramatically reduces the risk of fire and collateral damage derived from explosion and fire. Despite these advantageous factors, there are still some aspects that hinder the broadening of their use, such as the difference in thermal properties or the lack of accepted maintenance procedures for transformers that use them as liquid insulation. This paper presents the current status of biodegradable insulating fluids, analyzing some of their properties and discussing the aspects that are still to be investigated in order to make them a real alternative to petroleum-based fluids. © 2021 by the authors.

However, it is flammable and environmentally risky as it may be leaked or spilled. Therefore, ester fluids, which have been increasingly used in the last two decades, look promising as an ideal dielectric option. This research aims to better understand how using ester fluid insulation in power transformers impacts their physical and electrical dimensions, including their load-losses, impedance, masses, and equipment dimensions. Three case studies were carried out in a Portuguese electrical equipment manufacturer’s facility, with varying electrical parameters and physical properties of the mineral oil and ester-filled power transformers. The main results enhanced the known good electrical behavior of ester fluids, namely creating a lower electric field around winding wedges, yet the use of ester fluids led to higher load-losses, larger masses, additional radiators and, consequently, higher manufacturing costs. Nevertheless, the contribution of ester-filled power transformers to the improved environmental safety (reducing spillage and fire risks), among other advantages, makes ester fluids a truly eco-friendly option for power transformer design. © 2022 by the authors.",Electric fields; Electric losses; Electric windings; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Manufacture; Mineral oils; Minerals; Oil filled transformers; Power transformers; Coolant media; Design considerations; Dielectric medium; Eco-friendly; Ester-filled transformer; Insulation fluid; Load equipment; Load impedance; Power transformer design; Transformer design; Esters,electric field; environmental impacts; ester-filled transformer; insulation fluid; mineral oil; power transformer design,"T.

Further, a novel PHEVs' charging management method has been proposed from the distribution transformers' dynamic thermal modeling perspective. The proposed reliability evaluation method provided the precise stochastic model corresponding to the PHEV owners' behavior. The introduced reliability evaluation methodology has been applied to an actual distribution system of the Hormozgan Regional Electrical Company in Iran under various PHEVs' charging scenarios. The numerical results imply that the distribution transformers' failures are adversely affected due to unmanaged PHEVs charging. The system under study has been simulated during a 10-year-period. The test results show that the transformers' HST-dependent failures due to the PHEVs' charging demand load exponentially increased as a function of system age. As revealed by the results, the proposed PHEVs' charging management methodology mitigates the aggregated peak load and transformers' HST by deferring the peak charging load to midnight. © 2016 Author(s).",Charging (batteries); Crashworthiness; Electric power transmission networks; Electric transformer testing; Electric transformers; Hybrid vehicles; Reliability; Risk management; Smart power grids; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Charging managements; Distribution systems; Distribution transformer; Dynamic thermal modeling; Hottest-spot temperatures; Numerical results; Plug in hybrid electric vehicles; Reliability Evaluation; Plug-in hybrid vehicles,,"B.

Distribution power transformers have a crucial role in smart data-driven power networks, so diagnosing the faults that occurred in transformers is a vital issue. In this paper, a 1600kVA distribution power transformer was utilized to collect datasets by Frequency Response Analysis (FRA) method. Artificial Neural Network (ANN), as a powerful technique in pattern recognition, has been investigated to detect various mechanical and electrical defects.

Recently, machine learning (ML) techniques have played special role in fault diagnosis in power transformers; however, the application of such data-driven methods has been hampered by the lack of quality data to support their learning process. Since the collection of dissolved gas analysis (DGA) data depends on equipment failures, the obtaining of large labeled datasets that characterize incipient faults is a difficult task. The use of over-sampling techniques can overcome this challenge by providing a synthetic dataset with balanced classes for the ML method's learning process. This paper addresses a novel application of a deep neural network classifier for the diagnosis of a dataset enriched by the Borderline synthetic minority over-sampling method. The performance of the model was compared with those of traditional DGA interpretation methods, traditional multilayer percetron networks (MLP) and a DNN working with the original dataset. The results indicate the superiority of the approach, and a noise-resilience analysis conducted revealed its ability to deal with corrupted data. The methodology is of simple implementation, highly accurate, and capable of correctly classifying over 84% of the test samples. © 2021",Classification (of information); Diagnosis; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Large dataset; Power transformers; Quality control; Borderline synthetic minority over-sampling; Data driven modelling; Dissolved gases analysis; Faults diagnosis; Incipient fault diagnosis; Incipient faults; Learning process; Neural-networks; Over sampling; Power; Deep neural networks,Borderline synthetic minority over-sampling; Deep neural networks; Dissolved gas analysis; Faults diagnosis; Power transformers,"S.M.D.A.

The situation has been recently exacerbated in the wake of the ever-changing landscape of power systems driven by the growing uncertainty and volatility subsequent to the vast renewable energy integration, more frequent natural extreme events due to climate changes, increasing malicious cyberattacks, and more constrained transmission systems as the result of load growth and limited investments. On the opposite side, the proliferation of advanced measuring devices such as phasor measurement units, emerging electric and non-electric sensors, and Internet of Thing (IoT)-enabled data gathering platforms continually expand/nourish the databases; they hence offer unprecedented opportunities to take the advantage of data-driven techniques. Machine learning (ML) as a principal class of artificial intelligence is the perfect match solution to this need and has newly revoked many researchers’ interests to tackle the problems excluding their exact/detailed models. This paper aims to provide an overview on applications of ML techniques in power system protection and asset management. This paper elaborates on issues pertaining to (1) synchronous generators, (2) power transformers, (3) transmission lines, and (4) special and system-integrity protection schemes. In addition to the opportunities offered by the ML techniques, this paper discourses on the barriers and challenges to the wide-spread application of ML techniques in real-world practices. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Asset management; Climate change; Electric equipment protection; Electric power transmission; Internet of things; Investments; Machine learning; Phasor measurement units; Power transformers; Renewable energy resources; Security of data; Transmissions; Data driven technique; Internet of Things (IOT); Machine learning techniques; Power system protection; Real-world practice; Renewable energy integrations; System Integrity Protection Schemes; Transmission systems; Electric power system protection,Asset management; Machine learning; Power system protection,"F.

Thus, plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) can play a vital role in the reduction of pollution. However, high penetration of PEVs can pose severe challenges to power systems, such as an increase in energy losses and a decrease in the transformers' expected life. In this article, a new day-ahead co-optimization algorithm is proposed to reduce the unwanted effects of PEVs on the power system. The aim of the proposed algorithm is to minimize the cost of energy losses as well as transformer operating cost by the management of active and reactive powers simultaneously. Moreover, the effect of harmonics, which are produced by the charger of PEVs, are considered in the proposed algorithm. Also, the transformer operating cost is obtained from a method that contains the purchase price, loading, and losses cost of the transformer. Another advantage of the proposed algorithm is that it can improve power quality parameters, e.g., voltage and power factor of the distribution network by managing the reactive power. Afterward, the proposed algorithm is applied to a real distribution network. The results show that the proposed algorithm optimizes the daily operating cost of the distribution network efficiently. Finally, the robustness of the proposed algorithm to the number and distribution of PEVs is verified by simulation results.  © 2015 IEEE.",Charging (batteries); Electric losses; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Operating costs; Reactive power; Active and reactive power; Co-optimization; Cost of energies; Global transport; Power quality parameters; Purchase price; Reduction of pollutions; Smart charging; Plug-in electric vehicles,Daily operating cost reduction; energy losses; plug-in electric vehicle (PEV); transformer aging,"H.

The study is done for oil flow, temperature distribution, hot spot location and temperature of the winding, for three different cases: first, no oil leakage past the top washer; second, partial leakage due to a 2 mm gap between the top oil guiding washer and cylindrical pressboard; third, full leakage, i.e., no oil guiding washer. The effect of leakage is studied for both uniform and non-uniform heat loss distributions in the winding. The leakage is found to lead to an onset of a reversal in flow direction: in the horizontal channels of the last pass of the winding. Under the effect of leakage, the variation in thermal performance of the winding is substantial for uniform and negligible for more practically encountered non-uniform heat loss distribution. However, for non-uniform heat loss distribution, the leakage leads to two local hotpots as compared to one for the non-leakage case. The partial as compared to complete leakage is found to give almost same thermal performance.

However, the available DGA methods have certain limitations because every method depends on the concentration of the dissolved gases. Therefore, in this work, hybrid feature selection-artificial intelligence-gravitational search algorithm (GSA) techniques were proposed to determine the fault type of power transformers based on DGA data. The artificial intelligence (AI) methods applied include support vector machine and artificial neural network. Both AI methods were optimised by GSA to enhance the accuracy of the results. Feature selections using stepwise regression and robust regression were applied to utilise only significant gases. The accuracy of the results was tested with various ratios of testing and training data. Comparison of the results using the proposed method with other optimisation methods and the previous works was performed to validate the performance of the proposed technique. It was observed that the proposed hybrid feature selection-AI-GSA technique yields reasonable accuracy although fewer types of dissolved gases were used. Therefore, the proposed method can be recommended for the application of automated power transformer fault type detection based on DGA data in practice. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2020.",Dissolution; Gases; Learning algorithms; Neural networks; Power transformers; Support vector machines; Dissolved gas analyses (DGA); Dissolved gas analysis; Gravitational search algorithm (GSA); Gravitational search algorithms; Hybrid feature selections; Optimisation method; Reasonable accuracy; Stepwise regression; Feature extraction,,"H.A.

The integration of these resources with accurate stochastic models is expected to affect the assessment of the electrical distribution system (EDS) assets. This study proposes a new framework for evaluating and enhancing voltage quality, distribution transformer (DT) overload, and aging, while considering residential prosumer ownership of PEVs. The proposed work develops a probabilistic power flow in order to investigate the impact of the stochastic nature of PEVs, PVs, and conventional load. In this work, the residential premises are modeled for supply through a detailed secondary distribution system, which is integrated as a part of the EDS. This article enhances the existing research through the inclusion of PEVspatial-temporal (SAT)-charging activities into the assessment models of DT overload and aging, voltage imbalance, and voltage deviation. The proposed framework provides a more realistic life expectancy for DTs compared with a simplified model in the literature.

Thus, exploring the temperature distribution in the bushings is essential. This paper proposes a new thermal model to estimate the hotspot temperature (HST) of oil-impregnated paper (OIP) bushings, based on a modified thermal-electrical analogy model. The proposed model is developed based on the finite element method (FEM) to accurately model all fluid flow and internal convection as well as the thermal conduction mechanism. To this end, convection thermal resistances are defined, and their nonlinear characteristics are calculated for different overloading conditions. The proposed approach is applied on a 245 kV, 800 A OIP bushing to analyze not only the normal loading condition but also short-term overloading beyond the rated current. In addition, the oil flow condition with different load currents and transformer top oil temperatures (TTOT) are investigated. The results show a consistent temperature rise with the typical test conditions with no identified problematic situation. However, during overloading, the temperature rise exceeds beyond the permissible limits recommended by IEEE C57.19.

This work aims to propose a new optimization method inspired from growth and fecundity process of plants, which enable it to prune some branches of the plant or tree, that is, bad parts of the search space which do not meet the problem constrains and rapidly search the whole search space. By analogy, we can prune the search space of an optimization problem, cutting and ignoring its bad parts, the parts that certainly do not meet the problem constrains, so that the search speed and quality can be improved considerably. By improving the search quality, we mean to completely get rid of being trapped in local minimum. There are subtle similarities between pruning a tree to improve its fertility and pruning a search space of an optimization problem to improve the prosperity of optimization algorithm.

However, the dissipation factor of the Nomex samples is slightly higher than that of TUK, and the dielectric constant has the opposite behaviour. In addition, the decay content of Nomex/MEPKO was greater than with TUK/MEPKO.

This poses a serious problem for the grid, as most distribution transformers were installed during the pre-EV era, and thus were not sized to handle large loads from EVs. In parallel, smart grid technologies have emerged that actively regulate demand to prevent overloading the grid’s infrastructure, in particular by optimizing the use of grid-scale energy storage. In this paper, we rst analyze the load on distribution transformers across a small city and study the potential impact of EVs as their penetration levels increase. Our real-world dataset includes the energy demand from 1,353 transformers and charging proles from 91 EVs over a 1 year period, and thus provides an accurate snapshot of the grid’s current state, and allows us to examine the potential impact of increasing EV penetrations. We then evaluate the benets of using smart grid technologies, such as smart EV charging and energy storage, to mitigate the eects of increasing the EV-based load. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Electric transformers; Energy storage; Vehicle-to-grid; Distribution transformer; Electric grids; Energy demands; EV Charging; Penetration level; Potential impacts; Real-world; Smart Grid technologies; Electric power transmission networks,,,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,978-145035767-8,,,English,e-Energy - Proc.

The Integrated Resource Plan (IRP 2019) driven by the Independent Power Producers (IPPs) has committed to gen-erate, in excess, 18 GW capacity solely based on renew ables by 2030. To this end, the era of renewable energy technologies brings about a knowledge gap related to harmonics and distortion intro-duced by inverters and the use of non-linear loads. The design as-pects of the power infrastructure intended to operate in renewable energy technologies should incorporate special technical require-ments. A conventional distribution transformer does not meet this requirement. The step-up transformer is common in wind, concen-trated solar power and solar photovoltaic energy generation, in which, the significant generated harmonic losses on the trans-former result in hotspot temperature rise, thermal ageing and con-sequently, untimely failures. The basic assumption made by the IEEE Std C57.110-2018 that the winding Eddy losses in conduc-tors with dimensions less than 3 millimeters is progressive along with the square of the harmonic frequency is not consistent with conductors of larger dimensions, especially above the 5th harmonic order due to the skin effect. In this study, a corrected harmonic factor to accurately estimate the winding Eddy losses is proposed. The study is based on a hermetically oil-filled step-up transformer intended for service in a utility-scale solar photovoltaic plant. © 2021 IEEE.",Electric transformer testing; Electric utilities; Harmonic analysis; IEEE Standards; Oil filled transformers; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Thermal aging; Transformer windings; Distribution transformer; Hotspot temperature; Hotspot temperature rise; Independent power produc-ers; Power; Renewable energies; Solar pho-tovoltaic plant; Solar photovoltaic plants; Temperature rise; Winding eddy loss; Winding,distortion; distribution transformer; harmonics; hotspot temperature rise; Independent Power Produc-ers (IPPs); renewable energy; solar pho-tovoltaic plant; winding Eddy losses,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-166544231-2,,,English,"Int.

The study considers a neighborhood in the Portuguese municipality of Évora where buildings are set to become nZEBs using solar Photovoltaic systems. This transition is reproduced by simulation using real pre-transition electricity demand and climate data. Following the IEC 60076-7 standard to model the aging process of the considered DT, the collected results show that nZEBs can have a positive impact on the analyzed aging process. However, when relatively high nZEB integration levels are considered, this study also reveals that the subsequent reverse power flows can achieve relatively large magnitudes, especially around noon, thus accelerating the DT's aging into prohibitive values. Given the utmost importance of the nZEB concept for the European building stock, this study identifies nZEBs operation related issues that can result from excessive coincident on-site generation and presents a battery based power export limitation strategy to mitigate such impacts on DT aging. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Evora [Portugal]; Portugal; Buildings; Electric transformers; Photovoltaic cells; Solar power generation; Voltage distribution measurement; Distribution transformer; Electricity demands; Grid interaction; Integration levels; Low-voltage distributions; Photovoltaic systems; Reverse Power flows; Solar photovoltaic system; analytical method; building; demand analysis; neighborhood; photovoltaic system; power generation; smart grid; Zero energy buildings,Distribution transformers aging; Grid interaction; Low-voltage distribution grids; Nearly Zero-Energy Buildings; Photovoltaic systems,"R.A.

The algorithm can be used not only in the technical assessment of the individual units, but also to determine the relationships within the whole population. In this paper, the presented health index method consists of periodic oil diagnostics, including the physicochem-ical properties, dissolved gas analysis, and furfural content, and further assessment in terms of the criticality of the device to determine the technical condition. The algorithm was specifically de-signed to reflect even the smallest changes of the input parameters in the final score. The performance of the health index was tested on 620 oil analyses from 220 transformers divided into four subpopulations based on the service conditions. The results have proven to be largely dependent on the criticality level and the operating conditions of the device.

To have a reliable and continuous service, monitoring of transformers is a crucial issue. Maloperation or improper transportation can result in mechanical tension and stress on transformer windings. Axial displacement (AD) is one of the mechanical defects that can influence transformer operation through windings insulation degradation and short circuit faults. Frequency response analysis (FRA) is an efficient diagnostic technique widely used in transformers monitoring; however, interpretation of FRA results is complicated and is still under investigation. In this paper, AD faults are implemented on the 20 kV winding of a 1600 kV A distribution transformer. FRA traces are practically measured, and then the most sensitive and appropriate statistical indices such as cross-correlation factor (CCF), Lin's concordance coefficient (LCC), sum of errors (SE), and fitting percentage (FP) are employed to extract feature sets. All four components of the frequency responses, i.e., magnitude, phase, real and imaginary parts, are considered. Furthermore, an Artificial Neural Network using the obtained feature vectors is designed to detect the extent of the AD faults. The K-fold cross-validation method is used to evaluate the performance of the intelligent classifier.

Traditionally, power transformer fault diagnoses were enabled through gas-in-oil data, where erroneous diagnoses of faulty conditions as normal could have a more significant effect on power system operations than wrong diagnoses of normal operations as a faulty condition. Therefore, it is imperative to analyze gas-in-oil data characteristics more effectively to improve the performance of diagnostic methods. In this paper, an explainable bi-level machine learning method is proposed for oil-immersed power transformer fault diagnoses, consisting of a binary imbalanced classification model and a multi-classification model. The proposed Extreme Gradient Boosting models are designed with custom functions at each level, and automatic hyperparameters tuning is conducted based on Bayesian optimization. A fault feature selection is developed using the SHapley Additive exPlanations method to explain the diagnosis results, which could mine the impacts of fault features on diagnosis results and find the approach to improve the model performance. The fault diagnosis results are presented with performance analysis and comparative studies, and the feature selection results with importance analysis for each fault type based on SHAP value is provided, which demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2021",Fault detection; Feature extraction; Machine learning; Oil filled transformers; Power transformers; Dissolved gases analysis; Explainable machine learning; Extreme gradient boosted tree; Faults diagnosis; Faulty condition; Features selection; Machine learning methods; Normal operations; Power system operations; Transformer fault diagnosis; Failure analysis,Dissolved gas analysis; Explainable machine learning; Extreme gradient boosted trees; Feature selection; Power system operation; Transformer fault diagnosis,"C.

In an effort to achieve this goal, much research has been conducted on diagnosis approaches suitable for core components of the electrical power system. Transformers are one such core component. Most of the research on transformers has focused on developing a diagnosis model; less effort has been devoted to the data, in spite of the fact that such models require data of sufficient quantity and quality, which is not usually readily available for transformers. Thus, in this paper, we propose a way to fully exploit the valuable transformer data, using a data imputation approach called the iterative denoising autoencoder (IDAE) method. The proposed method imputes missing values of dissolved gas analysis (DGA) data, which is frequently lost, for various reasons. IDAE can help diagnose the health state of transformers accurately by estimating the missing values of DGA data. The proposed method is verified in this research through three comparative studies that examine field data provided by an electric power corporation. Specific studies provide: (1) a comparison with conventional methods on imputation performance for a single gas, (2) examination of imputation performance between multiple missing values, and (3) documentation of diagnosis accuracy before and after imputation. The results of the case studies show that the proposed method is effective for imputation of the missing DGA data. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Dissolution; Iterative methods; Learning systems; Auto encoders; Core components; Data imputation; De-noising; Denoising autoencoder; Dissolved gases analysis; Electrical power system; Iterative denoising; Missing values; Performance; Power transformers,Data imputation; Denoising autoencoder; Dissolved gas analysis; Power transformer,"T.

Power transformers and their components are vulnerable to various operational factors during their entire life cycle, which may lead to catastrophic failures, irreversible revenue losses, and power outages. Hence, it is crucial to investigate transformer condition assessment to grasp the operating state accurately to reduce the failures and operating costs and enhance the reliability performance. In this context, comprehensive data mining and analysis based on intelligent algorithms are of great significance for promoting the comprehensiveness, efficiency, and accuracy of condition assessment. In this article, in an attempt to provide and reveal the current status and evolution of intelligent algorithms for transformer condition assessment and provide a better understanding of research perspectives, a unified framework of intelligent algorithms for transformer condition assessment and a survey of new findings in this rapidly-advancing field are presented. First, the failure statistics analysis is outlined, and the developing mechanism of the transformer internal latent fault is investigated. Then, in combination with intelligent demands of the tasks in each stage of transformer condition assessment under big data, we analyze the data source in-depth and redefine the concept and architecture of transformer condition assessment. Furthermore, the typical methods widely used in transformer condition assessment are mainly divided into rule, information fusion, and artificial intelligence. The new findings for intelligent algorithms are also elaborated, including differentiated evaluation, uncertainty methods, and big data analysis. Finally, future research directions are discussed.

As a new environmental insulation liquid, natural ester can effectively delay cellulose insulation polymer ageing. Mastering the mechanism of natural ester delaying the cellulose ageing could promote its application in power transformers. In this study, based on the accelerated thermal ageing of pressboard immersed in natural ester and 25# mineral oil at 120°C for 221 days, the thermal ageing rate and the levelling off degree of polymerisation (LODP) for two kinds of oil-impregnated pressboards were compared. The molecular level mechanism of natural ester delaying cellulose degradation and keeping higher LODP value was proposed using molecular dynamics simulation. At the early stage of thermal ageing, cellulose with a higher degree of polymerisation (DP) can form many hydrogen bonds with hydronium ions, and their binding energy is stronger, which can accelerate the acid hydrolysis of cellulose, causing the DP of pressboard immersed in natural ester and mineral oil to decrease rapidly. With the breaking of the cellulose molecular chain, the number of hydrogen bonds and binding energy between cellulose and hydronium ions becomes smaller and the thermal ageing rate decreases gradually. At the end stage of ageing, it is difficult for the hydronium ions to enter the crystalline cellulose, acid hydrolysis of crystalline cellulose is hard to conduct, leading to the occurrence of the LODP phenomenon. The degradation rate of cellulose in natural ester is only 50% of that in mineral oil. The cellulose LODP value in natural ester is over 200 larger than that in mineral oil. Compared with the mineral oil-cellulose system, natural ester can form hydrogen bonds with hydronium ions and lead to fewer hydronium ions in cellulose, fewer hydrogen bonds and smaller binding energy between cellulose and hydronium ions, which can reduce the acid hydrolysis reaction of cellulose. This study provides a theoretical explanation for natural esters to delay the ageing of insulation paper. © 2021 The Authors.

The different samples were moistened with a glycerol solution, then sealed and stored for 12 days to allow further diffusion of moisture into the samples. Dielectric strength was statistically evaluated from IEC 60156. Partial discharge inception voltage (PDIV) experiment was performed in conformity with a modified IEC 61294 purpose at ambient temperature. Based on the experimental observations, the moisture has different behavior on dielectric strength and PDIV of insulating oils.

The main biodegradable fluids are the natural and synthetic esters, although biodegradable hydrocarbons have been recently proposed as well. Biodegradable fluids have a much lower environmental impact than mineral oil, limiting the risk of soil contamination in case of leaks what makes them a suitable solution for some applications, as off-shore transformers or railway transformers. Additionally, these fluids have higher flash point than conventional mineral oils what reduces dramatically the risk of fire and collateral damage derived from explosion and fire. Despite of these advantageous factors, there are still some aspects that hinders the spread of their use, such as the difference on thermal properties, the lack of accepted maintenance procedures and the price. This paper presents the current situation of biodegradable insulating fluids, analyzing some of their properties and discussing the aspects that are still to be investigated to make them a real alternative to petroleum-based fluids. © 2020 IEEE.",Environmental impact; Mineral oils; Petroleum analysis; Power transformers; Biodegradable fluids; Collateral damage; Current situation; Liquid insulation; Maintenance procedures; Soil contamination; Suitable solutions; Synthetic esters; Insulation,biodegradable liquids; distribution transformer; natural esters; Power transformer; synthetic esters,,Leonowicz Z.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-172817453-2,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

The early diagnosis of PD requires the high sensitivity and reliability of ultrasonic sensing systems. For this purpose, a reformative PD ultrasonic sensing system based on phase-shifted FBG (PS-FBG) was demonstrated. By using PS-FBG as the ultrasonic sensing unit, the ultrasonic sensing system improved the response to the ultrasonic signal and overcame the electromagnetic noise. To compensate for the influence of temperature change on the ultrasonic sensing system, an automatic wavelength scanning demodulating method was carried out. The wavelength spanning strategy was optimized based on the principle of cross-correlation, in order to quicken the spanning. A PD detection test in the transformer oil was conducted, and the result shows that PS-FBG was 17.5 times more sensitive than PZT. Because of the better ultrasonic response, the proposed system was able to achieve the early diagnosis of insolation faults in a power transformer. © 2022 by the authors.",Diagnosis; Electric transformer testing; Oil filled transformers; Partial discharges; Power transformers; Ultrasonic testing; Early diagnosis; High reliability; High sensitivity; Partial discharge detection; Phase shifted; Phase-shifted fiber Bragg grating; Sensing systems; Sensing unit; Ultrasonic detection; Ultrasonic sensing; Fiber Bragg gratings,fiber Bragg grating; partial discharge detection; power transformers,"X.

Presently, the interpretation of the dissolved gases is dependent on an expert's opinion at the power utility in the Republic of South Africa and often limited in the representation of the fault conditions. One of the drawbacks of relying on experts is the probability of error in judgement and diagnosis. Also, there are few experts in the field of transformer condition assessment. This paper aimed at evaluating the performance of the artificial neural network and support vector machine algorithms for the different established gas ratio concentrations methodologies on the Orange platform. To overcome the inaccuracies in these methods, a modified Doernenburg gas ratio method was proposed. Testing the model with a credible dataset of 922 field cases shows that the artificial neural network performed better with the accuracy of 97.5% of correctly predicted faults while the support vector machine is 90.4%. The modified method enhances the accuracy of the decisions in fault identification, thereby indicating a good application prospect in engineering practice. © 2022 IEEE.",Dissolution; Gases; Learning algorithms; Neural networks; Statistical tests; Support vector machines; Condition assessments; Dissolved gas; Dissolved gases analysis; Expert opinion; Gas ratio; Incipient faults; Incipientfault; Machine learning algorithms; Power utility; Transformer condition assessment; Power transformers,condition assessment; dissolved gas analysis; incipientfaults; machine learning algorithms; power transformer,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-166546887-9,,,English,"Proc. - South.

In this contribution, the distributed optical fibre sensor was creatively applied inside an operating 35 kV oil-immersed transformer which is also qualified for actual power grid operation through the ex-factory tests. Furthermore, the full-region temperature along the windings and iron limbs were firstly monitored in a spatiotemporally continuous manner and the hotspots were also closely traced, fluctuating at 90% of the high-voltage winding height (80% for low-voltage winding) during the whole process of the heat-run test. Corresponding Finite Element Method (FEM) for thermo-fluid field calculation was then utilized for deeper analysis. On the former basis, the actual detected temperature distributions (both spatial and temporal) were compared with the International Electrotechnical Commission traditional model and some modifications were suggested based on the real time measured data.

However, the uncontrolled charging of EVs would challenge the power system operation. Therefore, it is necessary to implement some level of control over the EV charging procedure, especially in the residential network. In this paper, an optimization of EVs charging scheduling considering energy arbitrage and the distribution network cost of an urban village environment is presented. The optimized strategy focuses on decreasing the loss of EV owners’ energy arbitrage benefit, introduced as the penalty cost. Also, peak demand, power loss, and transformer aging are included in the estimation of the cost function for the distribution network. The optimization problem is solved using the genetic algorithm. As a case study, data from the urban village in Udon Thani, Thailand, are utilized to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method. Simulation results show a reduction in the loss of energy arbitrage benefit, transformer peak load, power loss and the transformer loss of life. Therefore, the application of the optimized EV charging can prolong transformer lifetime benefiting both the EV owner and the distribution system operator. © 2020 by the authors.",Charging (batteries); Cost functions; Costs; Electric vehicles; Genetic algorithms; Housing; Optimization; Rural areas; Scheduling; Vehicles; Electric vehicle charging; Energy arbitrages; Internal combustion engine vehicles; Power system operations; Power-losses; Residential networks; Transformer loss of lives; Uncontrolled charging; Electric losses,Electric vehicle; Energy arbitrage; Optimization; Power loss; Residential network; Transformer aging,"R.

During the course of their in-service lifetime, the solid insulating system of windings is contingent on long-standing ageing and decomposition. The decomposition of the cellulose paper insulation is strikingly grievous, as it reduces the tensile strength of the cellulose paper and can trigger premature failure. The latter can trigger premature failure, and to realize at which point during the operational life this may occur is a daunting task. Various methods of estimating the DP have been proposed in the literature; however, these methods yield different results, making it difficult to accurately estimate a reliable DP. In this work, a novel approach based on the Feedforward Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network has been proposed to predict the amount of DP in transformer cellulose insulation. Presently, no ANN model has been proposed to predict the remaining DP using 2FAL concentration. A databank comprising 100 data sets—70 for training and 30 for testing—is used to develop the proposed ANN using 2-furaldehyde (2FAL) as an input and DP as an output. The proposed model yields a correlation coefficient of 0.958 for training, 0.915 for validation, 0.996 for testing and an overall correlation of 0.958 for the model. © 2022 by the authors.

However, limited work has been done in this area due to the difficulty of the model establishment. This paper proposes a two-stage feature extraction method for early warning of power transformer faults, where a novel feature extraction process is applied by combining feature ranking and genetic programming (GP). In the first stage, the data is labeled as normal and fault states and the feature extraction is evaluated on the data. Then, extracted key features and their growth rates are relabeled as normal and warning states, after which the feature extraction process is re-evaluated on the relabeled data. Obtained features and logic expression can finally be used for early warning.

One example is a power transformer and an electro-insulating liquid used in it. In order to meet these requirements, electro-insulating liquids should be characterized by, inter alia, high biodegradability and good fire properties. One of such liquids is natural ester. However, its oxidation stability is low in comparison to mineral oil and demands improvement, which can be achieved by the addition of an antioxidant. The authors of this work used fullerene nanoparticles for that purpose. Pure natural ester samples were prepared, and samples with two concentrations of fullerene, 250 mg/L and 500 mg/L in natural ester. All these samples were aged in a thermal oxidation process. Thereafter, the aging properties of all the samples were compared to assess the oxidation stability of modified liquids. Moreover, the electrical properties of prepared insulating liquids were investigated to assess if fullerene deteriorates these properties after aging process. Based on the obtained results, it was proved that the aging process slowed down in the case of both fullerene concentrations in ester. The acid number of natural ester modified using fullerene was lower than in the case of pure liquid. © 2021 by the authors.

However, these large machines are generally custom-made and tailored to the given application. During the design process the most economical design should be selected from thousands of applicable solutions in a short design period. Due to the nonlinearity of the task, the cost-optimal transformer design, which has the smallest costs during the transformers’ planned lifetime, is usually not the design with the highest efficiency. Due to the topic’s importance, many simplified transformer models were published in the literature to resolve this problem. However, only a few papers considered this preliminary design optimization problem in the case of superconducting transformers and none of them made a comparison with a validated conventional transformer optimization model. This paper proposes a novel FEM-based two-winding transformer model, which can be used to calculate the main dimension of conventional and superconducting transformer designs. The models are stored in a unified JSON-file format, which can be easily integrated into an evolutionary or genetic algorithm-based optimization. The paper shows the used methods and their accuracy on conventional 10 MVA and superconducting 1.2 MVA transformer designs. Moreover, a simple cost optimization with the 10 MVA transformer was performed for two realistic economic scenarios. The results show that in some cases the cheaper, but less efficient, transformer can be the more economic. © 2022 by the author.",Efficiency; Genetic algorithms; Power transformers; Superconducting materials; Conventional power transformer; Conventional transformer; Finite element analyse; Large machines; Large power transformers; Optimisations; Power transformer model; Superconducting transformer; Transformer design; Transformer modeling; Finite element method,evolutionary algorithms; finite element analysis; optimization; power transformers; superconductors,"T.

Ensuring the operational reliability of power transformers is an urgent task for the power industry in Ukraine and for most foreign countries. One of the ways to solve this problem is the correction of maximum permissible values of insulation parameters. However, such a correction is fundamentally impossible without an analysis of the laws of distribution of diagnostic indicators in the equipment with different states. The purpose of the research is to analyse the laws of distribution of the quality indicators of transformer oil with different states in 110 and 330 kV transformers. Novelty. It was found that both 330 kV autotransformers and 110 kV transformers have the displacements between the mathematical expectations of the distribution density of usable oil indicators. It caused by different service life of the analysed transformers and different values of load factors. This indicates the need to consider the influence of these factors when correcting the maximum permissible values of oil indicators. Also, the presence of displacement between the distribution densities of some indicators of usable oil in 110 kV transformers and 330 kV autotransformers has been revealed. It indicates a different intensity of oxidation reactions in transformers with different voltage class. In order to reduce the heterogeneity of initial data the procedure of statistical processing of in-service test results has been proposed as a method. This procedure combines the use of a priori information about the service life of equipment and values of load factors with the elements of statistical hypothesis testing. The results of the analysis of the distribution laws of transformer oil indicators with different states have shown that for both usable and unusable oil the values of oil indicators obey the Weibull distribution. Values of the shape and scale parameters for each of the obtained indices arrays have been obtained, as well as calculated and critical values of the goodness-of-fit criteria. Practical value. Obtained values of the distribution law parameters of the transformer oil indicators with different states, considering the service life and operating conditions allow to perform the correction of the maximum permissible values of the indicators using the statistical decision-making methods. © 2021, National Technical University ""Kharkiv Polytechnic Institute"".

This will likely require a combination of potentially costly distribution infrastructure upgrades and synergistic grid-transportation solutions such as managed charging and strategic charger placement. Fully implementing such strategic planning and control methods—including business models and mechanisms to engage and compensate consumers—can minimize or even eliminate required grid upgrades. Moreover, there are also opportunities for EV charging to support the grid by helping solve existing and emerging distribution system challenges associated with increasing distributed energy resources (DERs) such as solar generation and battery energy storage. This paper reviews the potential impacts of EV charging on electricity distribution systems and describes methods from the literature to efficiently integrate EVs into distribution systems. Recent Findings: Recent work has begun to extend beyond earlier efforts with limited adoption, simple controls, and mostly plug-in hybrid EVs and short-range EVs to look at high adoption rates of long-range EVs, larger distribution test systems, and more advanced EV charge control methods. In addition, increased interest and viability of higher power charging have prompted several studies showing how adverse impact from EV charging on electricity distribution systems can be exacerbated by high-power charging levels and concentrated EV adoption in certain areas. There has also been considerable recent effort to look at bulk transmission-level impacts of widespread EV adoption, which often includes a brief mention of distribution concerns, while also highlighting EV-distribution interactions as a key need for future work. Summary: The additional loads from widespread EVs could require costly upgrades to maintain distribution system reliability; however, careful planning and advanced operations strategies can reduce or eliminate such upgrade needs. Moreover, EV charging infrastructure can also support grid stability and improve distribution systems especially when paired with distributed solar, storage, or when equipped with smart charge management and grid-interactive support. Previous studies have found that impacts of unmanaged charging include limited load hosting capacity, transformer and line overloads, and voltage and power quality degradation. Past studies have also explored a wide range of opportunities to mitigate these impacts, including traditional upgrades, enhanced controls, and market design. However, the smaller-scale of most past studies limits their ability to capture impacts and opportunities introduced by managed EV charging, regional-scale movement of EVs, and more widespread EV deployment. With accelerated EV adoption driven by sustained technology progress, policy support, and rapid charging infrastructure deployment, it will become increasingly important to capture entire regions, rather than a single or a few feeders; to advance theoretical control developments to be simulated against more realistic and diverse distribution systems and to advance to widescale field deployments; and to develop more holistic approaches which incorporate EV charging alongside a variety of distributed energy resources. This will require enhanced collaboration across multiple disciplines to develop cost-effective and reliable solutions for the combined mobility and electricity systems of the future. © 2022, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.",Battery storage; Commerce; Electric utilities; Energy resources; Secondary batteries; Solar power generation; Vehicle-to-grid; Battery-electric vehicles; Control methods; Distributed Energy Resources; Distribution systems; Electric distribution systems; Electric vehicle charging; Electricity distribution systems; High power; Hosting capacity; Smart charging; Charging (batteries),Electric distribution system; Electric vehicle; Hosting capacity; Smart charging,"N.

One such advantage is the possibility of three-dimensional PD source localization. However, it is necessary to understand the signal propagation and attenuation characteristics in transformers to improve localization. Since transformers are available in a wide range of ratings and geometric sizes, it is necessary to ascertain the similarities and differences in UHF signal characteristics across the different designs. Therefore, in this contribution, the signal attenuation and propagation characteristics of two 300 MVA transformers are analyzed and compared based on experiments. The two transformers have the same rating but different internal structures. It should be noted that the oil is drained out of the transformers for these tests. Additionally, a simulation model of one of the transformers is built and validated based on the experimental results. Subsequently, a simulation model is used to analyze the electromagnetic wave propagation inside the tank. Analysis of the experimental data shows that the distance-dependent signal attenuation characteristics are similar in the case of both transformers and can be well represented by hyperbolic equations, thus indicating that transformers with the same rating have similar attenuation characteristics even if they have different internal structures. © 2022 by the authors.

The outage of selected transformer often results in an increased loading on the rest of transformers in the adjacent circuits. Any type of faults occurring on circuits or other elements during this period of time is likely to cause overloads on the remaining transformers which could lead to a breach of the Security and Quality of Supply Standards (SQSS). The transformer operational tripping scheme (OTS) is a technique for protecting transformers from overloading by tripping pre-selected groups of generations so that the loading on the monitored transformers can be relieved during the contingencies. An event-based transformer OTS has been constantly armed in the GB network. This paper presents a novel technique to integrate the real time transformer temperature estimation into an existing transformer OTS. This technique improves the OTS by reducing the number of unnecessary generation tripping, which is initiated from the overly conservative transformer ratings. This novel scheme will generate enormous economic benefits as well as provide significant flexibility to the GB system operator – National Grid Electricity System Operator (NGESO). The new scheme is an example of a Wide Area Monitoring, Protection and Control (WAMPAC) application. © 2022",Electric power system protection; Temperature distribution; Transformer protection; Wide area networks; Operational tripping scheme; Power; Power system; Protection and controls; SIPS; Temperature estimation; Transformer temperature estimation; Wide area control; Wide area monitoring; Wide area protection; Electric power transmission networks,Operational Tripping Schemes; Power System; SIPS; Transformer Temperature Estimation; WAMPAC,"Q.

This integration affects the power system operation and planning studies. Network-constrained unit commitment (NCUC) is one of important operation studies of electric power systems in which the aim is to schedule the generating units for the next 24-h period with the minimum operating cost considering the constraints of generating units and transmission network. One of the essential constraints influencing the results of NCUC is thermal rating of lines and transformers. In most of the previous studies, static ratings have been used for this equipment. The static ratings are conservative values leading to non-optimal use of real capacity of lines and transformers and increasing the system's operational costs. This issue is highlighted when there exist wind energy generations in system. A new NCUC problem is addressed in this paper that considers dynamic line rating (DLR) and dynamic transformer rating (DTR) in the presence of wind power generations. The proposed approach has been implemented on the 24-bus IEEE-RTS system in the GAMS environment in different experiments. The simulation results demonstrate effectiveness of the conducted model in reducing the operational costs and maximizing the usage of wind energy. © 2022",Electric power transmission; Energy utilization; Dynamic line rating; Dynamic transformer rating; Flexible network-constrained unit commitment; Flexible networks; Line ratings; Smart power; Smart power system; Transformer ratings; Unit Commitment; Wind power generation; electrical power; numerical model; power generation; renewable resource; simulation; wind power; Wind power,DLR; DTR; Flexible NCUC; Smart power system; Wind energy,"Z.

However, it is also important to understand the impact of it on the life of the other assets in a distribution system. Since, distribution transformers (DTs) are the important assets of a distribution system, the main objective of this paper is to appraise the impact of Volt-VAr control on the life of DTs. The paper presents a detailed methodology to estimate the loss of life (LoL) of the DTs under various Volt-VAr control schemes, such as base-case (without any control), voltage control, and Volt-VAr control (VVC). The proposed methodology is implemented on modified IEEE 13-bus and IIT-Roorkee distribution systems considering the voltage-dependent load models, seasonal load influences, and harmonics. The simulation results are presented to explore the ability of VVC in reducing the hottest-spot temperature in the DTs during peak hours. The results reveal that the life of the DT can be extended by a considerable amount by optimally controlling the voltages and reactive power flows in the distribution system. Moreover, it gives a significant reduction in energy losses and improvement in power factor in distribution systems. © 2019 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",Distributed power generation; Electric load flow; Electric power distribution; Electric power factor; Energy dissipation; Power transformers; Reactive power; Value engineering; Voltage control; Distribution systems; Distribution transformer; Hottest-spot temperatures; Load flow; Optimal controls; Power distribution control; Power factors; Voltage dependent load models; Power control,distributed power generation; distribution networks; load flow; optimal control; power distribution control; power factor; power transformers; reactive power; reactive power control; voltage control,,,Institution of Engineering and Technology,17518687,,,,English,IET Gener.

In these new models, adaptive filtering approaches work to adjust the learning rates of the evolutionary model, while the use of multivariable Gaussian membership functions, instead of single-variable as evolving models in general, makes information about interactions between input variables preserved and used in the training process. In addition, the evolving structure of the proposed models make these models more adaptable to changes in the operational conditions of power transformers (like insulation aging, environmental changes, load profile changes, among others) than its non-evolving counterparts. To evaluate the performance of the proposed models they were applied to two benchmark problems and to the thermal modeling of real power transformers problem under two load conditions: with and without an overload condition. The obtained results are compared with the performance of the original evolving Multivariable Gaussian and with other classical models suggested in the literature. Both proposed models obtained significantly higher performances than all the other tested models, suggesting that the models are flexible and efficient approaches in these scenarios representing a promising approach in the modeling of power transformers, especially for real-time applications. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Adaptive filtering; Adaptive filters; Benchmarking; Gaussian distribution; Information filtering; Multivariable systems; Power transformers; Thermoanalysis; Bench-mark problems; Environmental change; Evolutionary models; Evolving Fuzzy Systems; Gaussian membership function; Operational conditions; Real-time application; Set-membership adaptive filtering; Membership functions,Enhanced Set-Membership; Evolving Fuzzy Systems; Power Transformers; Thermal Modeling,"E.

One of the reasons is that power transformers are normally sized at planning stage according to their rated power limits instead of their thermal limits. The thermal limits are usually considered only in operation. In this paper, a new method is proposed to take thermal limits into account and size the wind farm transformer at planning stage based on the expected life of the transformer insulation. An analytical model of wind turbine wakes loss is combined with the transformer thermal model to calculate the expected lifetime of the transformer insulation more accurately. Different from the previous approaches, the proposed method considers both the wake effect and the time-varying ambient temperature. Results show that compared to using the constant temperature and predicted power output without wake loss consideration, the expected lifetime of transformer insulation evaluated after involving these two factors is closer to the result evaluated based on the measured wind power. © 2021 IEEE",Electric power system interconnection; Electric utilities; Power transformers; Temperature; Thermal insulation; Wakes; Expected lifetime; Planning stages; Power limit; Thermal limits; Thermal winds; Transformer insulation; Transformer size; Wake effect; Wake loss; Wind farm; Wind power,ambient temperature; transformer size; wake effect; wind power,"Z.

Sufficient insulation between different active parts are necessary for safe operation. Adequate insulation, it is not only necessary to insulate the coils from each other, or from the core and tank, but also guarantees the safety of the transformer against accidental surges, but with the growth in size and complexity of power stations, transformer is facing insulation problems. The evaluation of the transformer overload capacities certainly leads to complex variables that affect the operating life of the power and distribution transformer. In this study, the long-life calculation is performed on the basis of two experiments, which are related to the insulation degradation of the mineral oil and cellulose paper such as by adding different types of nano-particles to the mineral oil to enhance the strength of oil, and by changing the loads under different operating conditions to control the deteriorating rate of the insulation to prevent the life of the transformer. The insulation breakdown strength is improved from 37 kV to 71 kV by mixing the semiconductor nanoparticles such as gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC) and cerium dioxide (CeO2) with mineral oil.

The objective of this paper is to discuss the charging impact of BEVs on voltage across consumer-service points, as well as across the life of paper insulation under varying ambient temperatures (during winter and summer), with and without a centralized battery energy storage system (BESS). This study contributes in two ways. The first part of this study deals with coordinated and uncoordinated BEV charging scenarios. The second part of this study deals with maximum utilization of a test DT rated under dynamic thermal rating (DRoDT). The DRoDT integration with BESS is carried out to flatten the load spikes, to obtain maximum DT utilization, to achieve active power and voltage supports in addition to an enhanced DT lifespan. The obtained results indicate that, when test DT operates under the proposed hybrid technique (combining both dynamic transformer ratings and a centralized BESS), it attains maximum utilization, lower hot-spot temperature, enhanced lifespan, less degraded paper insulation and an improved voltage across each consumer service point. The proposed technique is furthermore found effective in maintaining the loading across the distribution transformer within the nominal limits. However, under excess loading during peak hours, the proposed technique provides relief to the DT to a certain extent. To achieve an optimal DT operation and an enhanced BESS lifespan, the BESS is operated under nominal charging and discharging cyclic limits. Under the proposed DRoDT integration with BESS, DT attains 25.9% more life when loaded with coordinated BEV charging, in comparison to no BESS integration under the same loading scenario. The worst loading due to uncoordinated BEV charging also brings 51% increase in DT life when loaded under the proposed technique.  © 2020 by the authors.",Automotive batteries; Battery electric vehicles; Electric transformer insulation; Electric transformer testing; Energy storage; Integration; Storage as a service (STaaS); Thermal insulation; Battery energy storage systems; Consumer services; Distribution transformer; Dynamic thermal ratings; Hotspot temperature; Hybrid techniques; Insulation failures; Transformer ratings; Charging (batteries),Battery energy storage system; Coordinated versus uncoordinated battery electric vehicles charging; Distribution transformer; Dynamic transformer rating; Paper insulation,"S.

In existing studies, transformer capacity increasing (TCI) decision is based on the hottest spot temperature (HST) and failure rate (FR). In consideration of operation risks, a short-term TCI method including two stages is proposed. Firstly, a preliminary TCI decision constrained by HST and FR is generated. Then, the economically optimal TCI decision between the preliminary TCI decision and full-loaded operation is searched for as the final decision on the basis of economic risk verification according to profit and loss of power enterprises and community. In a case study, the influence of transformer service time and planned TCI time on the short-term TCI results is discussed. And the proposed method is compared with the current TCI plan of power enterprises. The results show that the short-term TCI plan can be made flexibly with the proposed method that attends to both security and economy. © 2017 Automation of Electric Power Systems Press.",Economics; Failure analysis; Capacity increasing decision; Economy; Operation risk; Short term; Transformer; Oil filled transformers,Capacity increasing decision; Economy; Operation risk; Short-term capacity increasing; Transformer,"C.

To achieve that point, overload strategies under safe operation are discussed in this paper. Since dynamic line rating (DLR) is considered, the capacity and resistance of the overhead line, as well as risk of the power grid are all calculated under real-time environment and actual line situation. Overhead lines' overload strategy is proposed with the precondition of risk not exceeding the risk value calculated in the traditional method. In addition, transformers' overload operation needs to be applied in some scenarios. Overload strategy of transformers is also discussed under the limits of winding hot spot temperature and failure rate in our study, to ensure the reliability and safety.

However, the existing overload protection and stability and control strategies cannot adapt to this short-term power flow overload, so a large number of wind turbines need to be cut off, which is not conducive to wind power consumption. The paper analyzes the key parameters and safety boundaries of safety overload capacity for power equipment, and determines the long-term and short-term overload zones of transmission lines and transformers. According to the safety overload capacity of the equipment, the emergency overload operation strategy of the transmission channel is proposed, which is suitable for the grid connection of the wind farm cluster, including the heavy overload alarm based on the long-term overload zone, the wind turbine cutting-off and the over-limit-tripping due to the temperature rising of the equipment based on the short-term overload zone.

By using different charging strategies of EV, we can reduce the adverse effect of EV penetration in the peak load demand and hence improves load factor of system. A vehicle with the ability of V2G technology, presents many advantages like filtering of current harmonics, active power regulation, balancing of load etc. With these attributes, EVs provide various ancillary services like spinning reserve and regulation of frequency and voltage.

The optimal demand/generation profile is presented while considering utility price signal, customer satisfaction, and distribution transformer condition. The electricity home demand considers electric vehicles (EVs), Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs), and all types of non-shiftable, shiftable, and controllable appliances. Furthermore, PV-based renewable energy resources, EVs, and BESSs are utilized as sources of generated power during specific time intervals. In this model, customers can only perform Demand Response (DR) actions with contracts with utility operators. A multi-objective demand/generation response is proposed to optimize the scheduling of various loads/supplies based on the pricing schemes. The customers’ behavior comfort level and a degradation cost that reflects the distribution transformer Loss-of-Life (LoL) are integrated into the multi-objective optimization problem. Simulation results demonstrate the mutual benefits that the proposed HEMS provides to customers and utility operators by minimizing electricity costs while meeting customer comfort needs and minimizing transformer LoL to enhance operators’ assets. The results show that the electricity operation cost and demand peak are reduced by 31% and 18%, respectively, along with transformer LoL % which is reduced by 28% compared with the case when no DR was applied. © 2021 by the authors.

Today's fault diagnosis methods use intelligent techniques such as neural networks, support machines, hybrid techniques, among others. Although they present good results, these techniques find restrictions in the ability to determine the precise moment in the event of multiple and small-magnitude faults. The proposal includes a new algorithm based on fuzzy rules that incorporates the daily increase of dissolved gases in the transformer oil that improves the classification of incipient faults. With reliable samples of gas dissolved in oil, the method proposed in the research can obtain a total precision rate of 91.4%. In contrast, this degree of precision is lower in other conventional methods reported in the bibliography. In addition, its performance in the classification of multiple failures is 97.5%. The method uses fuzzy logic tools to suggest actions aimed at preventive maintenance by monitoring the total of combustible gases dissolved in the oil. The proposal is a simple and easy solution to implement in practice that allows determining the status of the transformer in service without affecting the continuity of the electricity supply.

A power transformer fault diagnosis model based on hybrid improved grey wolf optimization optimized least squares-support vector machine will be proposed as an attempt to improve the efficiency and accuracy of its fault diagnosis performance. First, the hybrid improvement method will be introduced with a view to solving the three problems that grey wolf optimization is troubled with, that is, premature convergence, slow convergence, and low population diversity. Then, six benchmark functions and Wilcoxon rank sum test are used to test hybrid improved grey wolf optimization and the other optimization algorithms, and the results show that hybrid improved grey wolf optimization has better optimization performance and significance. Finally, dissolved gas analysis data will be used for example simulation which will be further examined from three aspects in order to testify the fault diagnosis performance of the proposed method. The results show that the validity of the proposed method is much higher than that of the other models. Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed method can greatly improve the performance of transformer fault diagnosis, and has great practical significance in engineering. © 2022 The Authors.

However, machine learning has not been exploited effectively for fault diagnosis due to the limitation of multi-modal heterogeneity of data and the ratio of missing samples.

This trend seems to grow at more pronounced rate as nowadays there is a shift from using internal combustion (IC) engine based vehicles to EV due to their superiorities. EV chargers convert the ac power to dc power for charging of EV batteries. During this conversion of power by power electronics high frequency switching converters, harmonics are injected into the grid which degrades the power-quality of line current in the grid. Such injection of harmonics causes electrical and thermal overloading of distribution transformers thus affecting their life expectancy. Other problems include drawing of excess current from the grid, unbalancing between demand and supply in utility grid, voltage deviation in the grid, etc. Thus, it is required to maintain the IEEE-519 power quality standards during charging of EV.

However, the versatility of the data obtained at different temperatures is limited because of the temperature dependence of the PDC. In this respect, the universal conversion of PDC data at different temperatures is an essential aspect to improve the accuracy of the determination of insulating properties of cellulose materials immersed in the oil. Thus, an innovative temperature conversion method based on polarization time-varying current (PTC, obtained by multiplying the polarization current and time) is proposed in this article. In the current work, the PTC data at different temperatures are obtained from the oil-immersed cellulose pressboards with different moisture. Afterwards, the functional model based on the power series theory is used to simulate the PTC data, through which the coefficients of the power series are found related to the test temperature of the PTC and the moisture content (mc%) of the oil-immersed cellulose pressboards. Furthermore, the functional relationship among moisture, test temperatures, and the feature parameter calculated by these coefficients is established. Thus, the PTC data at various temperatures can be calculated by the established function. The potential application ability of the proposed method is verified by comparing the calculated results with the measured results obtained from the various samples. © 2020 by the authors.

Understanding the effective parameters on the transformer's failure is so vital to reduce the transformer outages. On the other hand, with improvement and extension of intelligent systems, identifying the effective parameters on the security of smart networks is of considerable importance. This paper clarifies the relation between the cyber network configuration (CNC) and the failure probability of transformers due to the distributed generator controller. Also, a novel method is proposed to determine the effects of various cyber network configurations on the failure probability of transformers and also select the best CNC to maximize the reliability of the cyber-physical system. Optimized configuration should maximize the data connection between cyber elements, particularly cyber elements that have cyber-power interdependency with the critical transformers in the power network. Results indicate that the improper CNCs can increase the failure probability of transformers and consequently it leads to increment of expected energy not supplied (EENS) of the power system. The proposed method is implemented on the real pilot power test system. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Cyber Physical System; Distributed power generation; Electric transformers; Embedded systems; Intelligent systems; Outages; Probability; System stability; Distributed generators; Distribution transformer; Effective parameters; Generator controller; Network configuration; Power; Power systems stability; SMART network; Thermal failure; Transformer failure; Controllers,Cyber-physical system; Distributed generator; Distribution transformers; Generator controller; Reliability,"B.

This paper proposes a smart coordinated control of photovoltaic (PV) and battery energy storage system (BESS) integrated in an EVCS in order to avoid transformer overloading. BESS is designed to provide the additional EV power demand which is greater than the transformer's rated capacity and thus reduce transformer overloading. In addition, the smoothing control of PV power output when PV output is lower than a threshold value is incorporated in the control method. Also, BESS which is used to provide grid services i.e battery to grid (B2G) is also incorporated in the designed smart control when the energy selling price is attractive to the BESS operator. Considering a single point connection type, B2G can only be implemented when there is no EV demand. Furthermore, B2G and battery recharging power is maintained within the transformer's rated capacity to avoid overloading during their particular services. Two different sizes of BESS and transformer capacity are considered to demonstrate the overloading of transformer for a particular time of the day. A small EVCS with integrated PV-BESS in a residential area and food center is simulated to validate the efficacy of the proposed coordinated control technique. Simulation results demonstrate that the integrated BESS with the proposed control method effectively minimizes transformer overloading during all the studied network operating conditions. Moreover, BESS successfully smooths out PV power output, provide grid service and recharge the battery within the defined rated transformer capacity and thus avoids transformer overloading while satisfying design constraints. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Charging (batteries); Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Grid computing; Secondary batteries; Battery energy storage systems; Battery to grid; Coupling transformers; Electric vehicle charging; Network operating conditions; Power smoothing; Transformer overloading; Uncontrolled charging; Battery storage,Battery energy storage system; Battery to grid; Electric vehicle; PV Power smoothing; Transformer overloading,"U.

It is necessary to detect and rectify the winding defect as soon as possible, because they are inherently progressive. One of the effective ways used to diagnose mechanical deformations of power transformers is Frequency Response Analysis (FRA). FRA has been standardized in previous studies but interpretation of the results is still being studied. Recently, results interpretation with the purpose of making the results more objective and quantitative has attracted attentions. To this end, this study presents a novel method for classifying faults which compares transfer function indices called statistical control chart. In order to solve this problem, for the first time, X-bar chart, R-chart, and S-chart with eight tests are used to interpret FRA results to detect different short circuits, axial displacement and radial deformation.

The feasibility and effectiveness of integrating individual monitoring components into a single complex with the organization of information and analytical support for decision-making based on the development of models and an algorithm for predictive assessment of the technical condition of power transformers are shown. Statistical models of pattern recognition formed using the Bayesian identification method able to provide a predictive assessment of the technical condition with a high degree of confidence, which allows identifying dangerous defects in transformers at an early stage of development and preventing any failures in the operation of the power facility equipment.

Mineral oil and synthetic ester were used as insulating liquids. It was found that the presence of water caused an increase in the permeability of the composite in the frequency range below 100 Hz. The value of static permittivity determined by water in the content of 5 wt. % was approximately 15. To obtain this value caused by liquid water, its volume should be approximately five (oil) and four times (ester) higher than its actual content, respectively. The determined values of the activation energy of the DC conductivity of the composites were several times higher than the values of the activation energy of the conductivity of the liquid water. The experimental values of the dielectric relaxation times were many orders of magnitude higher than the dielectric relaxation times of water. This means that the experimental results obtained for the dielectric permittivity, the activation energy of conductivity and the dielectric relaxation times for moisture electrical pressboard impregnated by mineral oil or synthetic ester exclude the possibility of the presence of liquid water in the composites. It was found that the conductivity of the composites increased exponentially with increasing water content. Such dependencies are characteristic of hopping conductivity, caused by the quantum phenomenon of electron tunnelling between nanometre‐sized potential wells. As the increase in conductivity is determined by the presence of water in the composites, therefore, the nanometre potential wells were single‐water molecules or nanodrops. :© 2022 by the authors.

The paper focuses on the changes in the health index values between the consecutive analyses. The algorithm used for this purpose was previously developed by the authors. The test group included 359 complete oil evaluation results from 86 power transformers monitored over several years. For each outcome, the influence of the sub-components of the main score was calculated. Additional health index increase simulations were performed based on the IEC 60599 standard guidelines. The highest increases and decreases in the total score were listed and analyzed to determine the main factors behind the changes. The study has shown that the changes in dissolved gases concentrations have a much more significant influence on the health index values than the changes in physicochemical properties of the oil and furfural content. Based on the magnitude of the observed changes and the simulation outcomes, the authors have proposed two assessment thresholds—the 50th percentile health index increase within a population as an alarm zone, and the 90th or 95th percentile increase as a pre-failure zone. © 2022 by the authors.",Electric transformer testing; Health; Physicochemical properties; 'current; Assessment criteria; Condition; Condition assessments; Consecutive analysis; Health indices; Index algorithms; Index values; Population management; Population studies; Power transformers,condition assessment; health index; population management; power transformer,"P.

To achieve the satisfying and valid operation of power transformers, any fault events that may impact their health ought to be evaluated and early warned. With such motivations, this paper presents original insights on the assessment of power transmission health states via their internal dissolved gas, and an enhanced Association Rule Mining (ARM) model incorporating the analysis of High-Impact-Low-Probability (HILP) components, as well as a dynamic fault event risk evaluation approach, is proposed. The first step is to differentiate the risky components. Unlike the standard ARM, the rarely occurred components in each feature can also be assessed explicitly as the common components to explore the underlying HILP components in the proposed model, rather than just being viewed as trivial data and directly omitted. The second step is to rate the risk level of each risky component. A component importance measure-based evaluation approach is deployed to assess the corresponding risk weights of distinguished risky components. In this approach, the risk weight is determined straightforwardly via the impacts of each component on the variation level of total risks in the system, rather than simply by its frequency of occurrence or data share. Finally, the parameters of the risk weight evaluation approach can be dynamically adapted in an adjustment framework as well. This model is testified through an empirical case study, and the leading results can demonstrate its flexibility and robustness during real applications.

Their accuracy is limited, since they are hard to learn from other algorithms to improve their own performance. To improve the accuracy of transformer fault diagnosis, a novel method for transformer fault diagnosis based on graph convolutional network (GCN) is proposed. The proposed method has the advantages of two kinds of existing methods. Specifically, the adjacency matrix of GCN is utilized to fully represent the similarity metrics between unknown samples and labeled samples. Furthermore, the graph convolutional layers with strong feature extraction ability are used as a classifier to find the complex nonlinear relationship between dissolved gas and fault type. The back propagation algorithm is used to complete the training process of GCN. The simulation results show that the performance of GCN is better than that of the existing methods such as convolutional neural network, multi-layer perceptron, support vector machine, extreme gradient boosting tree, k-nearest neighbors and Siamese network in different input features and data volumes, which can effectively meet the needs of diagnostic accuracy. © 2015 CSEE.",Backpropagation; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Nearest neighbor search; Network layers; Power transformers; Support vector machines; Trees (mathematics); Adjacency matrices; Convolutional networks; Diagnostic accuracy; K-nearest neighbors; Multi layer perceptron; Non-linear relationships; Similarity metrics; Transformer fault diagnosis; Multilayer neural networks,fault diagnosis; graph con-volutional network; Power transformer; similarity metrics,"D.

Hence, it is important to understand the degradation rate and corresponding behavioral aspects of different insulating fluids under various fault conditions. In this article, the behavior of mineral oil and two environmentally friendly fluids (a synthetic and a natural ester) are reported under arcing, partial discharges, and thermal fault conditions. Arcing, partial discharges and thermal faults are simulated by 100 repeated breakdowns, top oil electrical discharge of 9 kV for five hours, and local hotspots respectively by using different laboratory-based setups. Some physicochemical properties along with the gassing tendency of fresh and aged insulating liquids are investigated after the different fault conditions. UV spectroscopy and turbidity measurements are used to report the degradation behavior and dissolved gas analysis is used to understand the gassing tendency. The changes in the degradation rate of oil under the influence of various faults and the corresponding dissolved gasses generated are analyzed. The fault gas generations are diagnosed by Duval's triangle and pentagon methods for mineral and non-mineral oils. It is inferred that; the gassing tendency of the dielectric fluids evolve with respect to the degradation rate and is dependent on the intensity and type of fault.  © 2020 by the authors.",Degradation; Esters; Gas oils; Mineral oils; Partial discharges; Physicochemical properties; Power transformers; Ultraviolet spectroscopy; Uranium metallography; Vanadium metallography; Degradation behavior; Dissolved gas analysis; Electrical discharges; Energy transmission; Fault conditions; Insulating liquids; Operational factors; Turbidity measurements; Minerals,Ester fluids; Insulating liquids; Transformer,"U.M.

The service life of these devices depends to a large extent on the technical condition of their insulation system. Replacing mineral oils with natural or synthetic ester (retrofitting process) may increase the efficiency and operational safety of transformers, and also limit their adverse environmental impact. It is technically unfeasible to completely remove mineral oil from a transformer. Its small residues form a mixture with fluid ester, with different physicochemical and electric properties. Streaming electrification is one of the phenomena which, under unfavorable conditions, may damage the insulation system of a forced oil cooled transformer. It is necessary to run prophylactic tests for the ECT (electrostatic charging tendency) of insulating liquid mixtures from the point of view of transformer retrofilling, which is being used more often than before. The article presents the results of studies on selected physicochemical, and electrical properties, and the ECT of mixtures of fresh and aged Trafo EN mineral oil with Nycodiel 1255 synthetic ester. In this regard, the density, the kinematic viscosity, the conductivity, and the relative dielectric constant were measured. The molecular diffusion coefficient was determined using Adamczewski's empirical dependency. The streaming electrification was tested in a rotating disc system. The impact of the rotation time, the diameter, and the disc's rotation speed on the amount of the electrification current generated were analyzed. In addition, the co-relation between the electrification current and the composition of the mixture was determined using fresh and aged mineral oil. On the basis of the electrification model, the volume density of the qw charge was calculated, which is a parameter defining the ECT of insulating liquids. Based on the results, it was concluded that the synthetic ester is characterized by a higher susceptibility to electrification than the mineral oil. However, combining synthetic ester with a small amount (up to 20%) of fresh or aged mineral oil significantly reduces its ECT, which is beneficial from the point of view of retrofitting power transformers. © 2020 by the authors.",Electric power systems; Electric transformer testing; Electric utilities; Electrostatics; Environmental impact; Esters; Insulation; Mineral oils; Minerals; Mixtures; Oil filled transformers; Physicochemical properties; Power transformers; Retrofitting; Rotating disks; Adverse environmental impacts; Electrification model; Electrostatic charging tendency; Molecular diffusion coefficient; Operational safety; Relative dielectric constant; Streaming electrification; Technical conditions; Density of liquids,ECT; Insulation liquid mixtures; Mineral oil; Natural ester; Power transformers; Retrofitting; Rotating disc system; Streaming electrification; Synthetic ester,"M.

At present, the three-ratio method is mainly used to distinguish transformer faults, whereas such a method has some defects, such as insufficient coding and over-general fault classification. At the same time, on-site maintenance personnel make an empirical judgment based on various test data, which is subjective and uncertain to a certain extent. For cases with multiple abnormal data and relatively complex conditions, on-site personnel often need to discuss and even dismantle the transformer to identify the fault, which is time-consuming and costly. In order to improve the effect of fault diagnosis for traction transformer, this paper uses Bayesian network to correlate the cause and effect of various tests and faults. By combining the results of field tests, the fault is diagnosed by the causal probability of the Bayesian network, rather than relying on the exception that occurred in a single experiment to judge its fault. The diagnosis results are more accurate and objective by using the Bayesian network. In this paper, the frequent test anomalies of the traction transformer are taken into account in the network, so that the network can more comprehensively analyze the operation situation of the traction transformer and judge the type of fault. According to field situations, based on the existing set of symptoms of the Bayesian network fault diagnosis, this paper further considers the insulation resistance, dielectric loss tangent value, oil and gas, power frequency voltage, and leakage current. By combining the association rules algorithm and the experience of the field operators, the cause–effect relationship of test data and the conditional probability parameters of the network are obtained. Then, the Bayesian network is constructed and used for traction transformer fault diagnosis. The case study shows that the four types of fault diagnosed using the Bayesian network model proposed in this paper are consistent with the fault types inspected by on-site operators, which shows promising engineering application prospects. © 2020 by the authors.",Bayesian networks; Dielectric losses; Electric fault currents; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric power systems; Electric traction; Electric transformer testing; Failure analysis; Personnel; Petroleum prospecting; Statistical tests; Bayesian network models; Conditional probabilities; Dielectric loss tangent; Engineering applications; Insulation resistance; Maintenance personnel; Power frequency voltage; Traction power supply system; Fault detection,Association rules; Bayesian network; Conditional probability; Fault diagnosis; Traction transformer,"D.

The frequency response analysis (FRA) is widely used for detecting winding faults in a transformer. However, the direct measure of FRA for each split winding fails because the split windings are adopted to satisfy the impedance requirement of a high-speed railway, where the windings are connected inside the tank. A novel fault interpretation method based on image features and binary tree support vector machine (SVM) is proposed, which can get the condition of three windings in one measurement. Winding faults caused by different windings are simulated, including SC defect, axial deformation, and series capacitance variation, and the FRA curves are measured under various faults. Then, the features of the gray-level gradient co-occurrence matrix and the gray-level difference statistics are got from the polar plot of FRA. Finally, the image features are used as the inputs to the binary tree SVM for fault type and faulty winding classification. The results show that the proposed method has high accuracy for identifying fault type and faulty winding in AT.  © 2015 IEEE.",Binary trees; Deformation; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Fault detection; Frequency response; Railroad plant and structures; Railroad transportation; Support vector machines; Axial deformations; Fault interpretation; Frequency response analyses (FRA); Gray level differences; Gray level gradient co-occurrence matrices; High - speed railways; Series capacitance; Winding deformations; Winding,Autotransformer (AT); binary tree; image features; support vector machine (SVM); winding,"X.

Though various forecasting models have been developed, there is still room to further improve prediction performance. In this paper, a new forecasting model is proposed by combining mixed kernel function-based support vector regression (MKF-SVR) and genetic algorithm (GA). First, forecasting performance of SVR models constructed with a single kernel are compared, and then Gaussian kernel and polynomial kernel are retained due to better learning and prediction ability. Next, a mixed kernel, which integrates a Gaussian kernel with a polynomial kernel, is used to establish a SVR-based forecasting model. Genetic algorithm (GA) and leave-one-out cross validation are employed to determine the free parameters of MKF-SVR, while mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and squared correlation coefficient (r2) are applied to assess the quality of the parameters. The proposed model is implemented on a practical dissolved gas dataset and promising results are obtained. Finally, the forecasting performance of the proposed model is compared with three other approaches, including RBFNN, GRNN and GM. The experimental and comparison results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other popular models in terms of forecasting accuracy and fitting capability. © MDPI AG.

Current is the main culprit behind the heating of all electric devices. Excess heating leads to faster degradation of the insulation and lowers the breakdown voltage. These factors determine the lifetime and reliability of these devices, which can be extended by lowering the operating temperature via cooling. This paper aims to present the numerical investigation of the coupled EM–CFD model of a line reactor (LR) with two cooling systems: air-based natural convection cooling system (AN), and air-natural with water-forced cooling system (ANWF). The design of the inductor cooling system was presented and described. The numerical investigation of both cooling systems is done considering power loss generation, cooling efficiency, and temperature distribution. In addition, the EM–CFD models of examined devices were validated by experiments considering thermal measurements using calibrated thermocouples, thermal image camera, pressure and flow rate measurements, where the temperature was measured in at least 35 points with probes. The tests were performed for three operating currents, resulting in 100%, 75%, and 50% of total power losses in the inductor. The numerical models reach an accuracy in temperature difference with respect to experiments within 5 K and 3.5 K for AN and ANWF cooling, respectively. The presented research shows that the ANWF system is superior and provides significant temperature reduction up to 68 K as well as the maximum temperature of the windings was reduced up to approx. 29.0K at 390 A RMS by use of ANWF. Furthermore, the hot-spot temperature in AN cooling system reached 135°C, and up to 110°C for the ANWF system, which can be further decreased down to 60.0°C by lowering contact resistances. © 2021 The Authors",Air; Computational fluid dynamics; Cooling systems; Electric inductors; Electric lines; Electromagnetic simulation; Flow rate; Heating; Temperature; Thermocouples; Thermoelectric equipment; CFD-model; Coupled problems; Driven choke; Electromagnetic analysis; Filter inductors; Harmonic filter; Harmonic filter inductor; Numerical investigations; Operating temperature; Powerloss; Cooling,Computational fluid dynamics; Cooling; Coupled problem; Driven choke; Electromagnetic analyses; Harmonic filter inductor,"M.

Under heavy loading conditions, the hot-spot temperature of a transformer is the most critical parameter to determine the limit of loading. Therefore, to make an accurate estimation of hot-spot temperature and maintain the reliability of a power system, dynamic thermal models or methods must be employed. Due to the complexity of thermal phenomena, the methods presented so far needs to be improved to reduce computational errors. This is particularly the case for variable loading conditions and power utilities are still in need of good techniques. This paper describes two methods to determine temperature in single-phase, oil-immersed transformers. The first method calculates average windings temperature (AWT) using the voltage and current from primary and secondary windings. The second method, which uses data from the first method, determines the hot-spot temperature of the transformer.

The high interest on ester oil transformer has led to several analysis aimed at prediction of their dielectric analysis, thermal analysis and process development.

During oil directed (OD) cooling modes, the static pressure drop over the continuous disc type of winding determines the ester oil split among low voltage windings (LV) and high voltage windings (HV) which is connected hydraulically in parallel. In addition, the oil flow distribution in disc type of transformer windings in conjunction with power loss (no-load and load loss) of transformer will decide the location and magnitude of the hotspot temperature in transformer. Hence, there is still a technical challenge with ester oil for transformer manufacturers and utilities to use in large rating power transformers mainly in OD cooling modes. In this paper, the effects of mineral oil and ester oil on frictional pressure, gravitational pressure, oil flow rate, velocity in cooling duct, temperature distributions in top and bottom insulation, main winding zones, core, radiators and coolers are investigated under OD cooling conditions. The typical transformer rating of 60/75/90MVA, 220/33kV is considered for thermal analysis. Since, natural ester oil and synthetic ester oil are potentially different in thermal properties, the thermal analysis results are compared with mineral oil. The thermal hydraulic network model (THNM model) are used for fast calculations of thermal parameters in typical large power transformer.

Therefore, these transformers are widely used in many critical applications, such as hospitals, schools, shipping, airports, dams, and renewable energy power plants. However, the heat performance of these transformers is relatively poor because of the low thermal conductivity of the epoxy resin material they use that surrounds the core and coil. In addition, electrical losses increase with the rising power capacity of the transformer, so the losses cause overheating in the transformer core and windings. This situation results in thermal aging and insulation deterioration that reduces the service lifetime of the transformers. Thus, thermal analysis and effective cooling systems for the transformers are significant issues in order to increase the life of the transformers. In this study, a 250 VA 380/110 V three-phase, dry-type transformer was modeled and thermally analyzed using the ANSYS/Fluent program. The transformer was also tested under load conditions so that the thermal behavior of the transformer could be observed via a thermal imaging camera. In order to decrease the temperature rise in the transformer core and windings, different cooling configurations were tried by creating a cooling cabinet. The optimum cooling model was determined thanks to experimental studies. This model was also verified by simulation results. In dry-type transformers, the part where the temperature increases the most is the middle leg of the core and coils. Therefore, the air input through the middle leg of the core and the air output through the side legs of the core provide the greatest cooling of the transformer.

In addition, the structure of the winding and oil channel is much complex. In order to grasp the temperature distribution of the winding in large oil-immersed power transformer, based on the analysis of the loss and heat transfer in transformer, a multi-physical field coupled simulation model for 220 kV large oil-immersed power transformer is established. Based on the finite element analysis, the temperature-fluid field in the transformer is obtained. The results show that the temperature rises periodically along the axial height of the winding due to the influence of the oil baffle on the inside of the winding, and the local temperature distribution of the winding is unbalanced. The optimization design of the winding oil channel structure can improve the local unbalance of the temperature distribution of the winding and reduce the hot temperature of the winding. © 2019, Xi'an High Voltage Apparatus Research Institute Co., Ltd.

Two modes used for cooling fans, namely vertical and horizontal placement, will be compared as well. Four sets of radiators have been studied in this research, and in each set, 14 fins and three fans with a diameter of half a meter have been used. The fans will be arranged such that three of them will be placed under the radiator (in vertical position) in the first case, while in the second case, they will be located in one side of the radiator (in horizontal position). The results derived from the comparisons indicate the superiority of the horizontal mode in heat transfer against the vertical mode. Furthermore, it is notable that if the internal fan is disconnected, the cooling can be enhanced with the help of some existing points in the vertical mode. The improvement in heat transfer rate can be observed through locating the vertical fans optimally, once compared to the horizontal placement. The lower reliability of the vertical mode can be detected once the side fans are disconnected, while in any cases, the heat transfer superiority is achievable for horizontal mode. That is because, the disconnection of one of the fans, leads to the negligence of the radiators major parts in the vertical mode. © IMechE 2020.",Cooling; Horizontal wells; Oil filled transformers; Power transformers; Cooling fans; Forced airs; Heat transfer rate; Natural cooling; Oil-air; Vertical modes; Vertical positions; Radiators,Fan; oil forced air natural cooling; power transformer; radiator,"M.A. Taghikhani; Department of Engineering, Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran; email: taghikhani@eng.ikiu.ac.ir",,SAGE Publications Ltd,09576509,,PPENE,,English,Proc.

In the reduced radiator CFD model, the air flow simulation is replaced with an optimized air heat transfer coefficient (hair) equation. An experimentally verified full radiator CFD model, which includes the air flow simulation, has been introduced as a benchmark model for evaluating the validity of the reduced model. It was found that one hair can provide sufficient accuracy in simulating the air convection effect of transformer radiators. An hair equation was derived through a parametric study using the full radiator CFD model. The performance of the proposed hair equation was compared with the existing empirical equations, and its validities for different insulating liquids and different ambient temperatures were proven by additional CFD modelling. This hair equation can be transformed into a dimensionless form to help the radiator design and facilitate the complete-cooling-loop (CCL) based transformer CFD modelling.  © 1986-2012 IEEE.",Air; Atmospheric temperature; Computational fluid dynamics; Heat convection; Heat flux; Oil filled transformers; Power transformers; Radiators; Temperature measurement; Thermal insulation; Winding; (*email:; ) M wilkinson be with SGB-SMIT group; Atmospheric modeling; Be with university of manchester; Buffer zones; Computational fluid dynamic; Convection effects; Experiment NOMENCLATURE temperature () top oil temperature () - top oil temperature measured at the middle of top buffer zone in experimental setup () - top oil temperature measured at the outlet of winding in experimental setup () bottom oil temperature () - bottom oil temperature measured at the middle of bottom buffer zone in experimental setup () - bottom oil temperature measured at the inlet of winding in experimental setup () average oil temperature in radiator () ambient temperature () radiator surface temperature () total power dissipation by the radiator () heat flux by convection effect ((2)) heat flux by radiation effect ((2)) total oil flow rate at radiator top (3) density (3); Natural air; Netherlands; Oil; Oil flow rate; Oil insulations; Oil natural air natural; Oil naturals; Oil temperature; Power transformer insulation; Radiator surface; Surface temperatures; Thermal model; Top oil temperature; Total power dissipation; UK.; University of Manchester; Wilkinson; Surface temperature,computational fluid dynamics (CFD); experiment; heat dissipation; ONAN; Power transformer; radiator; temperature; thermal modelling,"Q.

However, the power transformers in service are subjected to various stresses like thermal stress and electrical stress, which may lead to several faults such as arching, partial discharge and overheating. In order to detect these incipient faults and ensure the normal operation of power transformers, the diagnostic methods based on Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) have been developed. However, the DGA methods suffer from low diagnostic accuracy. On the other hand, with the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), a lot of intelligent algorithms have been applied in this area. However, most traditional AI algorithms are hard classification, which may cause the wrong diagnosis of faults. To overcome those disadvantages, a method based on the improved DS evidence theory and multiple probabilistic output algorithms is proposed in this paper to improve the performance of fault diagnosis of oil-immersed transformers. Firstly, the performance of the soft and hard classification algorithms is compared and analyzed. After that, three diagnostic models based on the Multiclass Relevance Vector Machine (MRVM), Multiclass Support Vector Machine (MSVM) and Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) are established. In order to improve the accuracy of these models, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used to optimize their hyper-parameters. Finally, the combination of these three probabilistic output models is achieved based on the improved Dempster-Shafer (DS) evidence theory, which can help to obtain a more accurate fault diagnosis result by fusing multiple algorithm results. The case study results show that the proposed method achieves a probabilistic output for the fault diagnosis of oil-immersed transformers and overcomes the deficiency of traditional DGA methods which are difficult to get accurate diagnosis results and can't summarize the fault development rule inductively. © 2021",Backpropagation; Computer aided diagnosis; Electric power systems; Fault detection; Neural networks; Oil filled transformers; Partial discharges; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Power transformers; Support vector machines; Analysis method; Dempster Shafer evidence theory; Dissolved gases analysis; Fault diagnostic methods; Faults diagnosis; Oil immersed transformers; Performance; Power networks; Probabilistic output; Probabilistic output algorithm; Failure analysis,DS evidence theory; Fault diagnosis; Oil-immersed transformer; Probabilistic output algorithm,"Y.

This increases the demand of Mineral Oil (MO), which is on the verge of extinction and leads to conducting tests on natural esters. This work discusses dielectric endurance of Marula Oil (MRO), a natural ester modified using Conductive Nano Particle (CNP) to replace petroleum-based dielectric oils for power transformer applications. The Al2O3 is a CNP that has a melting point of 2072◦C and a low charge relaxation time that allows time to quench free electrons during electrical discharge. Al2O3 is blended with the MRO and Mineral Oil (MO) in different concentrations. The measured dielectric properties are transformed into mathematical equations using the Lagrange interpolation polynomial functions and compared with the predicted values either using Gaussian or Fourier distribution functions. Addition of Al2O3 indicates that 0.75 g/L in MRO has an 80% survival rate and 20% hazard rate compared to MO which has 50% survival rate and 50% hazard rate. Considering the measured or interpolated values and the predicted values, they are used to identify the MRO and MO’s optimum concentration produces better results. The test result confirms the enhancement of the breakdown voltage up to 64%, kinematic viscosity is lowered by up to 40% at 110◦C, and flash/fire points of MRO after Al2O3 treatment enhanced to 14% and 23%. Hence the endurance of Al2O3 in MRO proves to be effective against electrical, physical and thermal stress. © 2021 by the authors.

The rise in the power demand has put stress on the existing insulation system used for power transmission. Nanotechnology provides an advanced approach to upgrade the conventional insulation system by producing nano-oil with enhanced dielectric characteristics. The aim of the study is to present the influence of area volume effect on the dielectric performance of mineral oil and its nanofluids. In this paper, nanofluids are prepared by dispersing two different concentrations of SiO2 nanoparticles in base transformer oil using a two-step method. The effect of area and volume is investigated on nanofluids in the laboratory using coaxial electrode configurations under different test conditions. The AC breakdown voltage and maximum electric stress is determined for the pure oil and nanofluids. The results show that the addition of SiO2 nanoparticles significantly improves the dielectric characteristics of transformer oil. Moreover, the breakdown phenomenon is also discussed to analyze the effect of nanoparticle, stressed area, and stressed volume on the dielectric strength of insulating oil.

First, the experimental datasets of transformer winding failure are obtained, constituting the real space. Then, the transformer digital space models are constructed similarly to obtain the simulation datasets, constituting the virtual space. After that, the features of the samples in two spaces are extracted through windowing feature calculation, and the real-virtual space is obtained through feature hybridization. The final samples in the space are taken as the auxiliary dataset during the intelligent diagnosis process. The diagnostic accuracy with the proposed method increased by several percent than without.

Having said that, in this day and age a considerable number of harmonic producing apparatus are present. On the basis of their beneficial effects in efficacy and controllability, harmonic producing apparatus are presumed looking ahead to the realization of the 2030 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP 2030) to increase further. The IRP 2030 is aimed at increasing the total renewable energy generation capacity contribution to about 24.7% by year 2030. Further to this is a considerable increase in the amount of harmonics in the electric power network. The mushroomed harmonics and distortion may drive inflated winding stray loss and thereby peculiar temperature rise phenomena. Undue losses have classically been presumed to be varying in direct proportion with the harmonics order and load current.In this paper, the transformer losses that occur when facilitating solar PV farm environment are investigated based on seasonal basis. The study in particular draw attention to the injection of harmonics and distortion using the IEEE Std. C57.110-2018 recommended practice. In the worst-case scenarios for summer and winter the harmonic current measurements were taken to evaluate the guaranteed services losses. The hourly mean harmonic current profile for summer and winter solar irradiation of a solar PV farm are presented to investigate their effects on the operation of the transformer during service. The findings of the investigation is projected to be used as a foundation for the IPP's and manufacturers for operating and designing transformers serving large-scale solar PV farms within acceptable maximum rating in taking into account the availability of solar irradiation on seasonal basis and robust parametric design at tender stage respectively. © 2020 IEEE.",Electric power transmission networks; Electric windings; IEEE Standards; Irradiation; Renewable energy resources; Solar power plants; Solar radiation; Beneficial effects; Electric power networks; Guaranteed service; Integrated resources; Recommended practice; Renewable energy generation; Solar irradiation; Worst case scenario; Harmonic analysis,Harmonics and distortion; Renewable energy resources; Temperature rise.; Winding Eddy losses,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-172812956-3,,,English,"IEEE Int.

If its occurrence is not detected at an early stage, it can develop into a costly phase-to-ground fault. In this paper, a novel algorithm based on the fault-related incremental currents is proposed to detect a low-level transformer TTF. This paper shows that the performance of the proposed method is independent of the transformer operating condition. Therefore, it is reliable even under the presence of power system transients such as the external faults. In addition, the proposed algorithm can be configured uniquely and easily. This feature prevents the algorithm from unnecessary trips. These trips can be considered as the general problem that most of the past presented methods face. The experimental tests used for verification of the algorithm show that, regardless of the transformer winding configuration and its pre-fault operating conditions, the proposed algorithm can accurately detect the TTF, which involves only 1% of the winding turns, in less than one cycle of power frequency. The reliable and secure performance of the proposed algorithm shows that it can be widely used in the advanced numerical relays. © 1986-2012 IEEE.",Electric fault currents; Electric grounding; Electric relays; Electric transformer testing; Fault detection; Transformer windings; Winding; Differential relay; Inter-turn fault; Negative sequence protections; Operating condition; Phase-to-ground faults; Power system transients; Turn-to-turn faults; Winding configuration; Transformer protection,Differential relay; incipient inter-turn fault; negative sequence protection,"N.

DERs mainly involve distributed generation and energy storage systems; however, some definitions also include electric vehicles, demand response strategies, and power electronic devices used for their coupling with power grids. DERs challenge the entire operating system owing to their heterogeneous energy generation from renewable energy sources, the probabilistic nature of electric vehicle charging, and end-user exponential integration of power electronic devices. Research on DER integration has been conducted in the academic and industrial sectors. This study proposes a schematic literature review of DERs, including its modelling, description of deterministic and probabilistic power flow methods, power grid topologies for studies, and impacts of DERs on power grid operation. DERs are primarily modelled using probabilistic approaches. The most frequently optimized DER variables are sizing and location. Meanwhile, the most critical variables to analyse during their integration process to the power grid are voltage profile, frequency response, and charging of both lines and transformers, followed by less-proportional power quality indicators. Overall, DERs can improve the resilience of energy systems because they provide voltage and frequency support, reduce energy losses, enhance power quality indicators, and enhance energy recovery in extreme scenarios such as high-impact low-probability events. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Electric power transmission networks; Energy dissipation; Frequency response; Industrial research; Integration; Power quality; Renewable energy resources; Thermoelectric equipment; Distributed Energy Resources; Distribution power grids; Impact; Modeling; Modeling simulation; Power electronic devices; Power grids; Quality indicators; Simulation; Systematic Review; Electric load flow,Distributed energy resources; Distribution power grid; Impacts; Modelling; Simulation,"G.

However, using TCLs for demand response can result in an increase in TCL switching frequencies, which could affect distribution transformer (DT) temperatures. This paper explores the relation between DT overheating and TCL switching. We simulated a fleet of TCLs and found that higher switching frequencies result in lower maximum DT temperatures. We develop a DT-TCL model that estimates maximum DT temperatures as a function of the frequency of the power consumption of a small aggregation of TCLs, and we validate it through simulation. Additionally, we perform a case study to show that how TCL control impacts maximum DT temperatures. In general, control increases switching frequencies, reducing maximum DT temperatures; however, in some cases, it increases power amplitudes which can increase maximum DT temperatures. © 2015 IEEE.",Electric load distribution; Electric transformers; Renewable energy resources; Switching; Switching frequency; Demand response; Distribution transformer; Renewable energy generation; Thermostatically controlled loads; Electric transformer loads,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-146737389-0,,,English,"North Am.

Transformer is one of the most important electric equipment in the oil power system, whose reliable operation is of essential importance to the normal oil exploitation. Therefore, the condition of the transformer should be monitored continuously to find out the possible operating abnormality as soon as possible. The transformer temperature is a good indicator to reflect the transformer operating condition. Moreover, there is a large amount of historical operating data provided by the monitoring system in the oil platform power system, which can be used as the basis to distinguish the normal and abnormal operating condition of the transformer. In this paper, an abnormal temperature pre-warning method is proposed for the dry-type transformer in the oil platform power system. Based on the historical operating data, the dry-type transformer temperature model is established by the Sparse Bayesian Learning. The proposed model provides a temperature warning range. By entering the current transformer operating parameters into the model, the temperature range for a normal operating state can be obtained.

Transformers can be replaced based on their health indices, but they do not allow utility engineers to quantify risks posed by transformer failures. In that context, the study proposes a novel risk-based approach to plan the replacement of aged power transformers considering their temperature, apparent age, and expected capacity. The approach comprises a methodology that incorporates power transformers' winding hottest-spot temperature and apparent age into the conventional end-of-life failure model, a methodology that calculates the expected capacity of power transformers, a novel transformer ranking index, and a methodology that calculates the optimum year of replacement. Subtransmission and distribution substations were included in the IEEE Reliability Test System to evaluate the performance of the approach. The results show that incorporating the winding hottest-spot temperature and the apparent age into the end-of-life failure model can make a significant improvement on transformer replacement decisions in the event of limited availability of failure data. Results further suggest that end-of-life failures of fans and oil pumps can have an impact on the prioritisation of transformer replacement. © 2020 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

The purpose of this research work is to analyze how charging the EVs will influence the thermal performance of the oil-filled distribution transformer in power system network. Transformer thermal mathematical model is developed and different EV penetration scenarios are introduced and simulated. Each penetration scenario shows how a certain level of the EV connection affects the lifetime of the transformer.

Power transformers are amongst the most important equipments installed in power distribution systems. Therefore, this paper presents a novel methodology to improve the utilization of substation transformers. In this methodology, the transformer utilization of a two-transformer substation is increased via reconfiguration considering the single contingency policy (SCP). The online reconfiguration helps to maximize the amount of load transferred from a substation with a failed transformer to its neighboring substation. This load transfer maximization provides higher transformer capacity utilization possible. In the presented methodology, the load transfer is optimized through two hierarchical stages. In the first stage, the best configuration of the assisting substation is achieved. Then, in the second stage, load points that can be transferred from the substation with a failed transformer to its neighboring healthy substation are determined. In both of the stages, the reconfiguration problem is modeled as a mixed integer second-order cone programming problem. The IEEE 33 bus distribution network is considered as the test system and the results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in transformer utilization improvement. © 2016 IEEE.",Electric transformer testing; Integer programming; Power transformers; Reconfigurable hardware; Capacity utilization; Load transfer; Mixed integer; Network re-configuration; Power distribution system; Reconfiguration problems; Second-order cone programming; Utilization of resources; Transformer substations,load transfer; mixed integer cone programming; network reconfiguration; Tranformer capacity utilization,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-150902319-6,,,English,EEEIC - Int.

The action threshold of the existing backup protection (such as distance protection zone 3) reacting to the overload condition is determined by the static thermal rating. The action time is set according to the sequence coordination of upstream and downstream transmission lines. This strategy ineffectively adapts to the surge overload current after power flow transferring, may cause backup protection false trip and accelerate the cascading trip of power system. The parameters and their influential factors that represent the OEC of transmission equipment were clarified in this study. The dynamic OECs of the switchgear, current transformer, and overhead line on the transmission channel were analyzed. The heavy load warning method of the transmission section based on the predicted continuous overload endurance capability (COEC), and the load adjustment and overload protection strategy based on the short-time overload endurance capability (SOEC) were proposed. Finally, the feasibility and validity of the proposed methods were verified through a case study.

Besides, the operating condition of a transformer, the environmental temperature, wind, sunlight and other environmental parameters can also influence its internal temperature directly. By analyzing the thermal circuit model of transformer tank with inner heat source and the heat transmission process of the transformer, we investigated the ideal thermal circuit model of the transformer when the environmental conditions were stable. Moreover, we constructed a thermal circuit model of the transformer after taking the environmental temperature, solar radiation, natural wind velocity and other environmental parameters and operating states into consideration, and introduced the analysis method of thermal circuit model for the calculation of the hot spot and the top oil temperature. Furthermore, we calculated the top oil temperature and hot spot temperature of the transformer under non-rating operating state, and compared them with the measured values of the internal temperature for the actual transformer during its operating process. The results show that temperature calculated by the constructed thermal circuit model is close to the variation of the measured temperature, the maxmum calculation error is only 2.3℃, and the constructed thermal circuit model can effectively reflect the influences of the operating state of the transformer and environmental parameters on the internal temperature.

Finite Element Method is used as a method to evaluate the transformer losses under these conditions. Subsequently, the generated hotspot temperature and remaining service life of the transformer are evaluated.

During the production of a transformer, it is necessary to reduce its insulation's moisture content from about 8% to less than 1% in the shortest possible time period. The drying of insulation is a time-consuming process, and for high-power transformers, it can last up to three weeks. Several drying techniques are used during the production of a transformer, and all of them require heating up the insulation to a high temperature and applying a vacuum. Unfortunately, the use of a high drying temperature above 100 °C can cause a decrease in the degree of cellulose polymerization by over a dozen percentage points. This paper presents a new concept for drying cellulose insulation that does not require heating insulation and applying a vacuum. In this solution, methanol is used as the drying medium. The research results showed the possibility of drying cellulose insulation by means of methanol with different initial moisture contents. The possibility of completely drying pressboard of various thicknesses for a sufficient period of time was also proven. The paper also presents a new concept of both the device and the procedure for drying cellulose insulation by means of methanol. © 2018 by the authors.

The model is based on power chargeability balance and seeks to keep the load voltage within an admissible range. For achieving this, tap positions are adjusted in such a way that all TCP are set in similar/same power chargeability. The main contribution of this paper is the inclusion of several construction features (rated voltage, rated power, voltage ratio, short-circuit impedance and tap steps) in the minimization of power losses in TCP that are not included in previous works. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used for solving the proposed model that is a system of nonlinear equations with discrete decision variables. The GA scans different sets for tap positions with the aim of balancing the power supplied by each transformer to the load. For this purpose, a fitness function is used for minimizing two conditions: The first condition consists on the mismatching between power chargeability for each transformer and a desired chargeability; and the second condition is the mismatching between the nominal load voltage and the load voltage obtained by changing the tap positions. The proposed method is generalized for any given number of TCP and was implemented for three TCP, demonstrating that the power losses are minimized and the load voltage remains within an admissible range. © 2018 by the authors.",Electric losses; Genetic algorithms; Nonlinear equations; Power transformers; Chargeability; Construction features; Discrete decision variables; Power loss minimizations; Short-circuit impedance; Solution approach; System of nonlinear equations; Tap changers; Transmission control protocol,Genetic algorithms; Power chargeability; Power loss minimization; Tap-changers; Transformers connected in parallel (TCP),"Á.

This paper presents the interactions of the power transformer failures classification algorithms and health index calculation with the smart energy management system in an electrical grid and proposes a new monitoring approach of this component. This system can classify the different power transformer failures using predictive analytics. The integrated models calculate important characteristics such as loss of life, health index of oil quality, dissolved gas analysis and insulation paper. Since each fault of power transformer has an impact on the grid, the objective is looking for new correlations between different monitoring techniques of the power transformer with the power quality data acquired in the primary and secondary. These correlations results can reduce the cost of the instrumentation and the calculation time. A list of the requirements to design an optimized intelligent and online predictive maintenance system for power transformer is also proposed, integrating instrumentation, important KPIs and data to be monitored, stored, and analyzed.

In some power transformer oil maintenance conditions, the furan compounds test is not always become the primary and periodic test. Whereas the presence of a high amount of furan compounds will act as a conduction link and can initiate the breakdown. Thus it is necessary to determine the furan compound concentration especially 2-furfuraldehyde (FA) in oil periodically. In order to overcome the problem, the furan compound concentration, especially 2-furfuraldehyde, can be predicted by using Oil Color (Co), CH4/H2, Oil Acidity (AC), and Operation Age (T) by using the Supervised Machine Learning model i.e. Support Vector Regression and Random Forest Regression. The result shows that the best average MAPE is 0.48 which is gained by the Support Vector Regression with Polynomial Kernel.

Most faults cause changes in the thermal behavior of the transformer. Thus, a comprehensive thermal model and accurate estimation of hot spot temperatures are necessary for transformer condition assessment. A thermal-electrical analogous model based on the effects of solar irradiation and unbalanced transformer loading in each phase to estimate transformer top oil and hot spot temperatures is presented in this paper. Other variables considered in the model are the effects of the varying environment temperatures and the nonlinear thermal resistance of the transformer oil. The model is validated by using data collected from an in-service mineral oil immersed transformer. The simulated results of the proposed thermal models are in close agreement with the on-site measured values, with good accuracy especially in the case of hot spot temperatures. This indicates that the proposed thermal model is satisfactorily suitable for transformer top oil temperature and hot spot temperature calculation. © 2018 IEEE.",Irradiation; Power transformers; Solar radiation; Stress analysis; Thermal insulation; Thermography (temperature measurement); Transformer substations; Environment temperature; Hotspot temperature; Oil immersed transformers; Solar irradiation; Top oil temperature; Transformer condition assessment; Transformer insulation; Transformer loadings; Oil filled transformers,hot spot temperatures; solar irradiation; top oil temperature; unbalanced transformer loading,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-153864163-7,,,English,"IEEE PES/IAS PowerAfrica, PowerAfrica",Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85057856443

It is still a technical challenge for ester oil to utilize in transformers since higher viscosity of ester oil will leads to reduce the heat transfer process mainly in convection. With the ester oil in a transformer, there will be reduction of convection fluid currents which leads to higher temperature in top temperature oil and winding temperature rise in ester oil filled transformers. In this paper, the effects of mineral oil and ester oil on top oil rise, winding rise and hot-spot temperature arising from their potentially different thermal properties are investigated using Thermal hydraulic network model (THNM) on 60/75/90MVA, 220/33kV transformer.

A new numerical localization method based on the Newton-Raphson iterative method is presented. It reduces the number of sensors to only two. The propagation of an acoustic wave (AW), initiated by a Gaussian-type partial discharge inside a power transformer is analyzed.

A PV plant has various impacts on performance parameters of transformers. The working of on-load tap changer is also affected by the presence of PV. The main cause behind the altered performance of transformer in the presence of solar panel is its associated inverters that are used to supply linear loads. A higher temperature rise will occur in the windings and cores of the transformer due to voltage and current harmonics, resulting in extra losses.

Therefore, a large number of scenarios must be generated to integrate these uncertainties in the definition of a prediction-of-use (POU) tariff that encourages the PEVs to charge at certain times of the day. The main purpose of this article is to analyze the effects of scenario reduction techniques in the determination of an adequate POU tariff that considers the uncertainties associated with BL, PV generation and conditions of use of PEVs. The methodology proposed in this work considers the backward scenario reduction technique to determine the optimal charging power profiles of PEV aggregators through the Distribution System Operator (DSO) coordination. From the PEV optimal charging profiles, the DSO calculates a POU tariff for each aggregator, considering the uncertainties in of the problem. Results show that the use of scenario reduction techniques to determine the POU tariff reduces the computational burden without significantly affecting the obtained results. Finally, the simulation reflects the advantage of integrating PV generation in the distribution system, since using the proposed coordination strategy, the loss of life of the transformer slowed down. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Charging (batteries); Photovoltaic cells; Plug-in electric vehicles; Stochastic systems; Uncertainty analysis; Base-loads; Charging coordination; Condition; Coordination strategy; Distribution systems; Photovoltaics generations; Prediction-of-use tariff; Scenario reduction techniques; Scenario reductions; Uncertainty; Forecasting,Charging coordination; Photovoltaic generation; Plug-in electric vehicle; Prediction-of-use tariff; Scenario reduction; Uncertainties,"G.

As EV penetration grows, the power demand by EV for charging will increase, indicating a potential reshaping of load profile on the distribution network and likely impacts on the distribution transformers. This study forecasts EV load in a large residential network using specific probabilistic modelling approach. The EV load is estimated using light duty vehicles usage pattern based on a trip travel survey analysis. The trip survey is categorized into trip frequency, trip purpose, distance driven, trip time and duration of travel, which are all treated as distribution of probabilities. In addition to the trip survey analysis, the probabilistic model considers the EV type, model, battery capacity, state of charge, on-board charger level and fuel consumption to forecast energy demand by EV. The performance of the distribution transformers in response to the EV behavior are further investigated from the comparison of the proposed EV demand forecasting model with a generic Poisson model. The results show that, depending on EV penetration level, the distribution transformer can be overload, especially for EV participation higher than 50%. © 2019 IEEE.",Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Electric power transmission networks; Electric transformers; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Poisson distribution; Smart power grids; Surveys; Demand forecasting; Distribution transformer; Light duty vehicles; Loading models; Penetration level; Probabilistic modeling; Probabilistic modelling; Residential networks; Forecasting,Distribution Transformer; EV; Loading Model; Monte Carlo Simulation,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-153869567-8,,,English,"IEEE PES Conf.

Uncertain information, missing data, usually occurs in transformer fault cases and diagnosis tasks. To address these challenges, the authors proposed an integrated method of comprehensive transformer fault diagnosis. Diagnostic transformer rules extracted from fault cases form a decision-making table, whereby the main transformer monitoring information and fault types serve as conditional and decision attributes, respectively. Different fault-warning symptoms of the conditional attributes and corresponding decision attributes constitute diagnostic rules. Each obtained symptom in a diagnostic task is evidence supporting different fault types. A modified basic probability assignment (BPA) calculation method is proposed to determine the fault type probability by the obtained symptom. To address contradictory evidence, the symptom significance is introduced to design an improved combination rule incorporating all calculated BPA values to accomplish fault diagnosis. The obtained diagnostic results indicate that more symptoms and a higher symptom significance enable reliable transformer fault diagnosis. The recognition rate of the authors’ method reaches 91.2% with 12–14 symptoms and 94.3% for a 0.9 symptom significance coefficient. It is demonstrated that compared with other combination rules, their method attains a suitable performance (contradiction coefficient K = 0.9 at an 81.3% recognition rate) in realising contradictory information fusion. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2020",Decision making; Decision tables; Failure analysis; Power transformers; Basic probability assignment; D S evidence theory; Integrated decision makings; Monitoring information; Power transformer fault diagnosis; Reliable transformers; Transformer fault diagnosis; Uncertain informations; Fault detection,,"Y.

One of the most indispensable variables that regulate DTs’ operational life span is the hotspot temperature. The prevailing analytical approaches designated to guesstimate the transformer thermal necessities were fathered in accordance with the conservative foundation that an electrical transformer is prone to uniform mean daily and monthly peak loads. In order to appropriately puzzle out the transformer thermal necessities, the formation of a more detailed thermal model that operates with real-time contorted cyclic loading, ambient air temperature, and the intrinsic characteristics of the transformer in-service losses is required. In the current work, various regression models are proposed for the modification of the top-oil formula and the hotspot temperature formula in the IEEE loading guide standard to replicate the real harmonic load currents (HLCs) and the fluctuating ambient air temperature (AT) on an hourly and daily basis. The proposed thermal model is examined in various transformers case studies, in which the computed outcomes produce an error margin of no more than 3% throughout all test cases when compared to the measured data. © 2022 by the authors.

This algorithm is based on the behavior of the second central moment (SCM) to identify the kind of event. Instantaneous differential currents are used as input signals to the algorithm once they are filtered and normalized. The algorithm compares the magnitude of the SCM with an established threshold based on the binomial distribution to achieve a successful identification of the event. If the magnitude of the SCM is above the limit, the algorithm identifies the event as a fault condition. Otherwise, the event is determined as a transient event or a steady-state condition. The threshold is setting-free if the transformer parameters are changed or if the harmonic content of the differential current varies. Also, the threshold does not have to be recalculated if the power system is modified. The D index was introduced to improve the fault-detection time when the current transformers experience saturation. This index uses the magnitude of the SCM as a basis and is compared with an established limit to detect the fault current. Both indices run in parallel, and if any of them does cross its respective threshold, a fault condition is determined. The algorithm is tested in a real-time digital simulator and is implemented in MATLAB. The algorithm was compared against the conventional differential protection with harmonic restraint to evaluate the performance of both indices in critical conditions. The results validate the performance of the algorithm and indicate that it can be the basis of a new algorithm to protect power transformers. © 1986-2012 IEEE.",Electric fault currents; Electric power system protection; Fault detection; Power transformers; Differential algorithms; Differential protection; In-rush current; Real time digital simulator; RTDS; Second central moments; Steady-state condition; Three-phase transformers; Transformer protection,differential protection; inrush current; Power transformer; RTDS; second central moment,"H.

For this reason, they are more and more often used as an alternative to conventional mineral oils. Esters are used to fill new or operating transformers previously filled with mineral oil (retrofilling). It is technically unfeasible to completely remove mineral oil from a transformer. Its small residues create with esters a mixture with features significantly different from those of the base liquids. This article presents electrostatic charging tendency (ECT) tests for mixtures of fresh and aged Trafo EN mineral oil with Envirotemp FR3 natural ester from the retrofilling point of view. Under unfavorable conditions, the flow electrification phenomenon can damage the solid insulation in transformers with forced oil circulation. The ECT of the insulating liquids has been specified using the volume density of the qw charge. This parameter has been determined using the Abedian-Sonin model on the basis of the electrification current measured in the flow system, as well as selected physicochemical properties of the liquids. It was shown that ECT is strongly dependent on the type of insulating liquid and pipe material, as well as the composition of the mixtures. The most important finding from the research is that a small amount (up to 10%) of fresh and aged mineral oil is effective in reducing the ECT of Envirotemp FR3 natural ester. © 2020 by the author.",Biodegradability; Electric utilities; Electrostatics; Esters; Insulation; Liquids; Mineral oils; Minerals; Mixtures; Oil filled transformers; Physicochemical properties; Power transformers; Electrostatic charging tendency; Flow electrification; Insulating liquids; Insulating properties; Oil circulation; Solid insulation; Synthetic esters; Volume density; Density of liquids,Dielectric liquid mixtures; ECT; Insulating liquids; Insulation aging; Insulation diagnostics; Mineral oil; Natural ester; Retrofilling of power transformers; Streaming electrification; Synthetic ester,"M.

Unfortunately, during the drying process, the ester is systematically contaminated with mineral oil, which reduces its water absorption. Information on the oil concentration in the mixture is needed in two cases: when deciding how to treat the mixture, and during the treatment. The article presents two methods: (1) based on the measurement of the mixture density, and (2) based on the measurement of a capacitor immersed in the mixture. The most important scientific achievement of the work is the proof, by way of experiment, of the existence of a relationship between the concentration of mineral oil and (1) the density of the mixture, and (2) the capacity of the capacitor immersed in it.

The propagation process of the pulse signal in the transformer winding is analyzed, and the distribution parameter circuit model of the transformer winding reflecting the propagation process is established. The variation law of wave impedance after inter-turn short circuit is derived. By inputting a low-voltage pulse at one end of the transformer winding, the response characteristic curve can be collected at the other end, and the characteristic curve is obtained by combining the two response characteristic curves before and after the inter-turn short circuit. Whether the inter-turn short circuit fault occurs or not is determined by the characteristic curve is raised or not. The characteristic curve's protrusion degree reflects the severity of the intern-turn short circuit fault. Combined with artificial neural network algorithm, the fault identification rate of the proposed method is analyzed, and the simulation sample analysis shows that fault identification rate of the proposed method is up to 95%.

In this paper, a two-stage charging strategy is proposed to alleviate the transformer aging caused by EV charging and reduce the charging cost. In the first stage, an initial charging power curve is obtained by solving an optimization problem, which minimizes the transformer aging during the control period. In the second stage, the charging process of each EV is scheduled considering all the information of connected EVs in the charging station, which minimizes the charging cost along with the penalty for deviation from the initial charging power curve. Simulations have been carried out using the actual charging records of Beijing. The results show the charging processes of EVs can be properly scheduled during the parking time and the goals of reducing charging costs as well as transformer aging can be achieved using the proposed charging strategy. © 2020 IEEE.",Charging (batteries); Cost reduction; Curve fitting; Electric automobiles; Electric transformers; Charging process; Charging station; Charging strategies; Control periods; Distribution transformer; Electric vehicle charging; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Optimization problems; Electric transformer loads,coordinated charging; electric vehicle; residential charging demands; transformer aging,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-172819164-5,,,English,iSPEC - Proc.: IEEE Sustain.

This paper proposes a calculation method for time-process power flow considering the thermal behavior (TPPFCTB) of transmission components to calculate the temperature dynamics of overhead lines, power cables, and transformers under anticipated system operation scenarios. The TPPFCTB model is represented by differential-algebraic equations, which can be solved as a sequence of extended power flow problems at discretization time intervals. Based on the Newton method, incomplete and complete decoupling methods are proposed to decouple the correction equations into several independent groups with constant coefficient matrices, thus improving computational efficiency. The work presented in this paper provides an effective method for the detection of potential power transfer capability problems associated with transmission components, thus guiding operators to make more economical decisions.

A fundamental challenge here is that high resolution is necessary to resolve the fluid flow phenomena, but this makes simulation of the full geometry very expensive in terms of computational power. In this work, we develop a simulation methodology that combines a porous-medium approach for simulating some regions of the domain, coupled with fully resolved simulations in those regions which are deemed most interesting to study in detail. As one does not resolve flow features like thermal boundary layers in the regions modeled with the porous approach, the resolution in these parts can be orders of magnitude coarser. This multiscale approach is validated against the use of fully resolved simulations in the whole domain, as well as against analytical solutions to the extended Graetz problem. We then apply the approach to the study of oil flow and heat transfer in large electric power transformers and demonstrate a significant reduction in computational cost compared to a fully resolved approach. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Boundary layers; Computational geometry; Flow of fluids; Heat transfer; Oil filled transformers; Porous materials; Power transformers; Computational costs; Efficient simulation; Electric power transformers; Fully resolved simulations; Multi-scale approaches; Porous medium approach; Simulation methodology; Thermal boundary layer; Transport properties,Computational fluid dynamics; Electric power transformer; Heat and fluid transport; Multiscale simulation; Porous medium,"O.H.H.

Total cost of ownership is the standardized methodology to consider the lifetime costs of a power transformer already in the pre-concept design stage. There still does not exist a widely accepted method to calculate the carbon footprint of power transformers. In this paper a carbon footprint based optimization is presented for a realistic, sub-station transformer selection problem. A two-winding, metaheuristic transformer optimization method is used to calculate transformer optimal key-design parameters. The optimal losses and main parameters of the transformer are compared with the result of TCO optimization.

In order to find out the law of average winding temperature gradient under overload operation, a calculation model for steady temperature rise of transformer under overload is presented in this paper. Firstly, a global oil momentum model is established based on fluid resistance. Then, according to the coupled heat transfer between winding, oil flow and radiator, a control equation describing temperature distribution is established using energy conservation law. Simultaneously, a three-dimensional numerical model of transformer and the temperature rise test platform are established to verify the proposed model. Studies show that, according to the design parameters, the average temperature gradient of transformer winding under overload operation can be obtained using the calculation method presented in this paper.

Core joint design is one of the factors related to the losses. In previous studies, core losses and flux density distribution motivated researchers to design appropriate T-joints. However, the variation of load and thermal profiles are the most important factors related to the losses in transformers. This study proposed a new T-joint configuration for the core of the 3-phase transformer. The proposed model was built after considering the variation of load and thermal profiles. Results were compared with those of conventional T-joint designs, such as butt-lap and 45° mitered designs, that are currently used. The no-load losses of the proposed model were reduced by more than 6.8% and 10% compared with those of the butt-lap and mitered T-joint designs, respectively. Furthermore, the total losses, the hot spot temperature of the core, and the oil temperature decreased significantly. The proposed model contributes to the literature on new T-joint designs for improving transformer performance.

Forecasting of the dissolved gas content in oil is widely conducted for transformer faults, but its accuracy is affected by data scale and data characteristics. Based on phase space reconstruction (PSR) and weighted least squares support vector machine (WLSSVM), a forecasting model of time series of dissolved gas content in transformer oil is proposed in this paper. The phase spaces of time series of the dissolved gas content sequence are reconstructed by chaos theory, and the delay time and dimension are obtained by the C-C method. The WLSSVM model is used to forecast time series of dissolved gas content, the chemical reaction optimization (CRO) algorithm is used to optimize training parameters, the bootstrap method is used to build forecasting intervals. Finally, the accuracy and generalization ability of the forecasting model are verified by the analysis of actual case and the comparison of different models. © 2020 by the authors.",Chaos theory; Chemical reactions; Dissolution; Electric power systems; Forecasting; Gases; Phase space methods; Support vector machines; Time series; Vector spaces; Bootstrap; Chemical-reaction optimizations; Dissolved gas; Phase space reconstruction; Transformer; Weighted least squares; Oil filled transformers,Bootstrap; Chaos theory; Chemical reaction optimization; Dissolved gas content in oil; Forecasting; Phase space reconstruction; Transformer; Weighted least-squares support vector machine,"J.

The present work emphasises analysing the behaviour of the converter transformer concerning the harmonics in the input. The process involves designing a stepped configuration of a 240-MVA converter transformer using the finite element method (FEM). The designed model is analysed as per its structural dynamics to obtain its vibrational response for different ranges over the frequency spectrum. Furthermore, the module of acoustics and thermal analysis is coupled to the vibrational model. The coupled model serves as an efficient tool in analysing the impact of different orders of harmonics on the vibrational, acoustic and thermal performance of the core of the converter transformer. The computational effort taken in solving the coupled field problem is simplified by designing a neural network model and the prediction efficacy of the network is enhanced by using a Hybrid of Particle Swarm Optimisation and Gravitational Search Algorithm (HPSOGWO) as tuner of the internal parameters of the neural network. The significance of the designed model is also examined against other well-versed hybrid algorithms in the literature in terms of various statistical indices. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Finite element method; Harmonic analysis; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Structural dynamics; Thermoanalysis; Computational effort; Converter transformers; Coupled field problems; Gravitational search algorithms; Internal parameters; Neural network model; Particle swarm optimisation; Vibrational response; Neural networks,acoustics; artificial neural network; finite element analysis; harmonics; magnetostriction; optimisation; thermal hotspot; transformer modelling,"S.

However, these transformers have some drawbacks related to dimension, cost and efficiency depending on it. Thus, the main aim of this study is to get the optimum transformer design based on winding size and efficiency that are related to transformer long lasting with low loss. Therefore, transformer manufacturers will produce more efficient and long lasting dry-type transformer. First of all, the mathematical model of the single-phase dry-type transformer is qualified in detail so the transformer parameters are obtained. Secondly, optimum efficiency depending on the winding sizes, C coefficient and losses are evaluated by Firefly algorithm (FA). Thirdly, the electromagnetic transient analysis of the dry-type transformer have done by ANSYS/Maxwell program. Fourthly, thermal analysis of the transformer windings and core are done by PLC measurement station. Finally, the theoretical results are validated by experimental results using a prototype set. The obtained results showed that the optimization based on windings size and efficiency is resulted by increasing the durability and reliability of the transformer.

There are issues for the distribution network operator if BEV charging is allowed to take place without any control on the time of day, duration or charging rate. Specifically, the network voltage may fall below prescribed limits at times of peak demand and power flows may cause a thermal overload of assets. The existing literature on scheduling charging/discharging of BEVs makes use of decentralised/centralised control architectures to study the effect of charging/discharging of BEVs on distribution network. This paper presents a teaching-learning algorithm method to optimally charge and discharge the BEVs and hence mitigate the adverse impacts on the distribution network by considering the driving behaviour of car owners. This approach has resulted in reduced transformer loading even when using V2G and G2V modes of operation of the BEVs and hence has prevented transformer aging in low voltage distribution networks. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Automotive batteries; Charging (batteries); Electric automobiles; Electric discharges; Electric power distribution; Electric transformers; Electric vehicles; Learning algorithms; Voltage distribution measurement; Charge and discharge; Charging/discharging; Control architecture; Distribution network operators; Distribution transformer; Low voltage distribution network; Power distribution network; Smart charging; Battery electric vehicles,Aging of the distribution transformer; BEV battery; Distribution network; Electric vehicles; Smart charging and discharging,"B.

However, uncontrolled increase of EVs would challenge the power-distribution-system operation, which includes the reduction of distribution transformer lifetime. Therefore, it is necessary to implement some level of control over EV charging procedure, especially in the residential network. In this paper, we present an optimization method for EV charging considering a transformer aging factor in an urban village environment. The optimized strategy focuses on the reduction of the charging cost, power loss and peak load power. The optimization problem is solved using the Genetic Algorithm (GA) in MATLAB. As a case study, we have used data from the village in Udon Thani, Thailand to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method.

Ultrahigh-frequency (UHF) sensors in the frequency spectrum higher than 300 MHz can detect electromagnetic waves emitted by PD. However, for practical placement inside a transformer, the size and frequency bandwidth of a UHF sensor for PD detection are a worry. To detect the PD signal early, sensors with high sensitivity and multiband frequency are required. Sensors with high sensitivity and multiband frequency are required to detect the PD signal early on. This paper presents a variety of side dimension sizes and thicknesses of a 4th order Hilbert fractal UHF sensor for PD detection inside a power transformer. This UHF sensor was designed to capture PD signals at frequencies ranging from 300 MHz to 3 GHz. The sensor is designed by using CST software where the setting the dimension of 40 mm, 50 mm, 60 mm, 70 mm, 80 mm, 90 mm, 100 mm and 150 mm for length and width with different thickness which is by fixed and by formula with an FR4 epoxy substrate of thickness 1.6 mm. Based on the simulation results, the suggested sensor can measure PD signals with a reflection coefficient of less than -10 dB and a VSWR of less than 5. This sensor's benefits include a wide bandwidth, excellent sensitivity, and an appropriate size for straightforward installation. As a result, this sensor has been approved for use in the power transformer as a UHF PD detection sensor.  © 2021 IEEE.",Bandwidth; Electromagnetic waves; Fractals; High frequency transformers; Partial discharges; Signal detection; CST software; High sensitivity; Hilbert; Hilbert fractal; Multi-band frequencies; Partial discharge detection; Partial discharge signal; Sensors models; Transformer; Ultra high frequency sensors; Power transformers,CST Software; Hilbert Fractal; Partial Discharge; Transformer; UHF Sensor,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-172819253-6,,,English,IEACon - IEEE Ind.

Moreover, the gas-sensitive response characteristics of GaNNTs to C2H4 gas were studied after the clusters formed by doping 1~4 Pd atoms, respectively. It is found that the Pd atoms doping on the surface of nanotubes, acting as adsorption active sites, can effectively improve the adsorption performance of GaNNTs for C2H4 gas. Based on the calculations of adsorption structure, charge transfer, density of states, energy band structure, and molecular orbital, the gas sensing response mechanism of doped GaNNTs to C2H4 gas was analyzed in detail. Combined with desorption, it is found that Pd4-GaNNTs show the best gas sensing response performance to C2H4.

To clarify the bubble dynamics and the effect on the electric field, a gas-liquid two-phase flow model was established based on the finite element method, and the effects of oil flow rate on the trajectory and deformation of bubbles in horizontal and vertical oil ducts were studied by simulation. The results show that the bubble shape periodically pulsates at a frequency of 100 Hz in the power-frequency electric field. In the horizontal oil duct, the deformation of bubbles in the vertical direction increases with the increase of oil flow rate, whereas the electric field distortion decreases. In the vertical oil duct, the deformation of bubbles in the horizontal direction decreases with the increase of oil flow rate, whereas the electric field distortion increases. To verify the simulation model, an oil circulation device with a horizontal oil duct and a bubble motion observation system were set up. The motion and deformation images of bubbles in the horizontal oil duct were captured, showing that the bubble shape also periodically pulsated at a frequency of 100 Hz. The deformation rates of the bubbles at different oil flow rates were extracted, which are in good agreement with the simulation results. © 2020, High Voltage Engineering Editorial Department of CEPRI.

However, the data, which has been used in those algorithms, are not consistent with the diversity of locations, thus, do not meet the expected results. Grid locations are the most important aspects of this issue in the eyes of designers, investors, and the general public.

By developing smart-grid infrastructures, effective utilization of the DN’s components and proper management of the DN would create a valuable solution for DN operators. Hence, in this paper, a peak-load management framework is proposed in which the real-time rating of the components and voltage-dependent features of the electric loads help the DN operator handle the peak times successfully. In addition to the individual advantages of efficient operation of the DN, more practical results are obtained by combining the conservation voltage reduction (CVR) and dynamic thermal rating (DTR) of the DN’s lines and transformers. Based on the obtained results, compared to the individual implementation of CVR, the cost-saving level is increased significantly during the peak events using the simultaneous utilization of DTR and CVR. Furthermore, a discussion is presented about the current problems of the feeders supplying the voltage-dependent constant-power loads during CVR utilization, which is resolved by the dynamic rating of the DN’s components. © 2022 by the authors.",conservation; distribution system; power generation; reduction,conservation voltage reduction; demand response programs; distribution network; dynamic thermal rating,"B.

During the operation of DT, the internal temperature distribution is not uniform. Hotspot temperature is the most representative parameter. It can reflect the temperature change and insulation aging rate of the DT to guide the actual operation. The hot-spot temperature can be calculated by building the thermal circuit model of transformers. Both the IEEE and IEC standards provide methods for building the thermal circuit model based on the top oil temperature rise and the bottom oil temperature rise. These thermal circuit models are all single-phase model. They assumed that there is no heat exchange for each phase of transformers when the three-phase load are same. However, these models are not applicable to the three-phase unbalanced transformers. The three-phase unbalanced operation of DT is unavoidable in practice. In order to solve this problem, a modified three-phase thermal circuit model for DT was proposed in this paper. It considered the influence of the three-phase unbalanced operation. It modified the traditional thermal circuit model which is based on the top oil temperature rise. The modified model was compared with the standard models through the actual examples. The results showed that the modified model proposed in this paper can reflect the hot-spot temperature of each phase for DT. Compared with the traditional thermal circuit models, the modified model considered the effect of three-phase unbalanced operation. It can accurately calculate the hot-spot temperature of the DT in theory. © 2020 IEEE.",Electric transformers; IEEE Standards; Timing circuits; Distribution power networks; Distribution transformer; Hotspot temperature; Internal temperature distribution; Oil temperature rise; Thermal circuit model; Top oil temperature; Unbalanced operations; Circuit simulation,Distribution transformers; Hot-spot temperature; Thermal circuit model; Three-phase unbalanced operation; Top-oil temperature,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-172819606-0,,,English,"IEEE Conf.

Existing study focus on overloading constraints like hottest-spot temperature (HST) and failure rate, but the transformer operation risk is rarely considered in overload strategy making. This paper firstly proposes an operation risk analytical method of oil-immersed transformers, to evaluate the transformer loss, power grid enterprise loss and society loss during overloading. Considering the operation risk, a two-stage overload strategy is presented. In stage 1, the security constraints including HST, failure rate and the proposed risk are discussed to obtain a preliminary strategy; in stage 2, benefits and costs of overloading are calculated to analyze the economy of strategies between preliminary strategy and full-loading, and the profit-optimal strategy will be chosen as the final strategy. The validity of proposed overload strategy and influence of transformer service time on strategy making is demonstrated through case study. © 2017 IEEE.",Economics; Electric power transmission networks; Failure analysis; Investments; Outages; Economy; Equipment investment; Hottest-spot temperatures; Oil immersed transformers; Operation risk; Overload strategy; Security constraint; Transformer; Oil filled transformers,Economy; Operation risk; Overload strategy; Transformer,,,IEEE Computer Society,19449925,978-153862212-4,,,English,IEEE Power Energy Soc.

In order to improve the accuracy of transformer fault diagnosis, a transformer fault diagnosis model based on IFA-LPboost-CART is proposed here. First, a LPboost-CART model is established. The classification and regression tree (CART) are used as the weak classifiers, and the linear programming boosting (LPboost) ensemble learning method is used to adjust the weight of each weak classifier to construct a strong classifier. Then the improved firefly algorithm (IFA) is adopted to optimize the number of CART and the maximum number of splits of CART in LPboost-CART to obtain the IFA-LPboost-CART model. The experimental results show that, compared with the existing methods, such as CART and support vector machine (SVM), the proposed IFA-LPboost-CART model has higher fault diagnosis accuracy, which can provide technical support for transformer fault diagnosis. © 2021 The Authors.

On this basis, in order to qualify and quantify the impact of EV battery charging on a distribution system, is proposed a probabilistic analysis through Monte Carlo method to formulate a transformer load curve. The basis scenario, without comprising EV charging, is estimated based on grid characteristics. The estimation of consumer's average daily distance driven and average grid connection time are used to formulate the EV charging scenario through two charging strategies: Economic and dumb charging. While the first is based on time of use tariff, motivating the charging at low tariff charges, the second is based on driver's usual trip recurrence time.

The lifetime of a transformer is mainly attributable to the condition of its solid insulation, which in turn is measured and described according to the degree of polymerization (DP) of the cellulose. Since the determination of the DP index is complex and time-consuming and requires the transformer to be taken out of service, utilities prefer indirect and non-invasive methods of determining the DP based on the byproduct of cellulose aging. This paper analyzes solid insulation degradation by measuring the furan concentration, recently introduced methanol, and dissolved gases like carbon oxides and hydrogen, in the insulating oil. A group of service-aged distribution transformers were selected for practical investigation based on oil samples and different kinds of tests. Based on the maintenance and planning strategy of the power utility and a weighted combination of measured chemical indicators, a neural network was also developed to categorize the state of the transformer in certain classes. The method proved to be able to improve the diagnostic capability of chemical indicators, thus providing power utilities with more reliable maintenance tools and avoiding catastrophic failure of transformers. © 2021 by the authors.

In the past, maintenance personnel had to spend plenty of time on examining consumers' transformers one by one. Nowadays, with the wide deployment of power user electric energy data acquire system (PUEEDAS), informative metering data are becoming available, which can be utilized for further condition monitoring. Thus, this paper proposes a data-driven abnormal condition monitoring algorithm of data acquisition for consumers' transformers, which could timely send abnormal condition alerts to operators and maintenance personnel. In the proposed algorithm, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is utilized to show the degree of correlation among phase currents, and its t-Statistics is used to determine whether abnormal condition of data acquisition exists based on the hypothesis testing. Finally, actual acquisition data from Zhejiang power system in China are employed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, and to analyze the characteristics of normal and abnormal conditions, respectively. Sensitive analyses on different significant levels and sampling rates are performed for considering its impact on monitoring results; the application in real power systems is also given to demonstrate the practicality of the proposed algorithm. © 1986-2012 IEEE.",Data acquisition; Electric transformer testing; Personnel; Data driven; Degree of correlations; Electric energy datum; Hypothesis testing; Maintenance personnel; Operation reliability; Rank correlation coefficient; T-statistics; Condition monitoring,Abnormal data acquisition; consumers' transformers; data-driven; hypothesis testing; t-statistics,"Z.

Conventionally, transformer failure rate is calculated with hot spot temperature induced from IEEE empirical equations. This article firstly introduces a spatial and temporal related failure model based on three-dimensional thermal simulations of transformer and the related environment. The proposed thermal model is established with computational fluid dynamics for ventilation calculation and heat generation equations for power device simulation. Cooling strategies and mutual heating effect of power equipment are considered for an accurate temperature distribution prediction. By incorporating the three-dimensional thermal model into the service life-dependent and temperature-dependent model, the failure rate of each spatial point in power transformer could be calculated according to Arrhenius theory and Weibull distribution.

The stability of the power system is depending more and more on the safety and reliability of transformers. Health Index (HI) is a practical tool that combines complex condition data into a single value as a comparative indication of the overall condition of a transformer. Most of the existing health index procedures are based on laboratory or on-site test data, with few considering the actual operating time. In this research, a comprehensive assessment method of transformer operating condition is proposed. Based on the HI model, this method the first considers the aging process of the transformer insulation as well as the load and operating environment to form the theoretical health index HI1. The aging process is characterized by the operating time of the transformer, the load rate, and the pollution level. The test health index HI2 is then formed based on on-site tests. The final health index HI is obtained with the combination of HI1 and HI2 to characterize the health condition of the transformer. To make sure the proposed method can be readily adapted in the field, only traditional parameters with well-established interpretations are required. This method has been applied to assess multiple 330kV transformers in service and provided a useful method to transformer asset management. © 2022 The Author(s)",Electric power transmission networks; Electric transformer testing; Health; Ageing process; Condition assessments; Health index model; Health indices; Index models; On-site tests; Operating time; Sustainable operations; Test data; Transformer; Power transformers,Condition assessment; Health index model; Sustainable operation; Transformers,"H.

A reliable and coherent maintenance schedule, that would predict the causes and prevent un-expectable shutdowns of power transformers, is of outmost importance nowadays, since electrification is expanding in terms of volume and power, as well as in terms of production sources, voltage and location. Such a reliable and coherent maintenance schedule depends on many factors and this article describes the parts of oil-immersed power transformers that are prone to failure. It also illustrates the relationship of the well known dissolved gasses that appear in the insulating oil as a result of specific operating faults, with specific measurements that should be done periodically, in order to prevent a major failure. Additionally, it describes the relationship between these dissolved gases with specific maintenance actions that should be implemented during the preventive maintenance process. © 2022 The Author(s)",Condition based maintenance; Failure (mechanical); Outages; Power transformers; Preventive maintenance; Condition assessments; Critical component; Critical measurements; Dissolved gas; Electrical power; Maintenance schedules; Network likes; Operating condition; Power distribution network; Scientific community; Mapping,Condition assessment; Critical infrastructure; Failure analysis; Maintenance; Mapping; Power transformers,"C.

Boskovica 32, Split, HR-21000, Croatia","Transformer preventive maintenance scheduling—as an integral part of the power utility company's asset–management process—if optimized properly affords considerable savings in maintenance costs and results in the increased reliability of transformer stations. However, situation is exacerbated by the considerable uncertainty involved in the assessment of the transformer health status, not necessarily associated with its age, as well as in the projected asset replacement and maintenance costs. There is also uncertainty inherent in the transformer tests as such. This paper proposes a novel transformer optimal preventive maintenance scheduling approach, with the use of the Bayesian statistical learning and a generalization of the Bayesian networks, for decision-making based on the expected utility hypothesis. Proposed approach, in essence, manages risk associated with taking different preventive actions by leveraging uncertain information regarding the transformer health and the expected costs of these actions. In this way, each prospective decision has a monetary value attached to it, which depends on the particular circumstances defined by the power utility company. Time-related effects are introduced into the decision-making process by the Bayesian updating of the prior belief concerning the transformer health with new information. Solving a decision problem amounts to determining an (optimal) strategy that maximizes the expected utility for the decision maker. On top of that, Bayesian approach, uniquely, offers explicit account for the full uncertainty associated with every step of the decision-making process. The proposed approach, and its advantages, will be demonstrated on a fleet of power transformers. It will be shown that model can predict with a 90% accuracy and a high confidence the transformer health index class from a small dataset. It will also be shown that it can predict with high expected profits which transformers in the dataset would benefit the most from the early intervention (recuperating around 25% of the projected costs and retaining over 90% of the projected savings). © 2020",Asset management; Bayesian networks; Costs; Decision making; Electric transformer testing; Health; Health risks; Learning systems; Life cycle; Power transformers; Scheduling; Bayesian learning; Health indices; Influence diagram; Life cycle analysis; Transformer; Preventive maintenance,Asset management; Bayesian learning; Health index; Influence diagrams; Life-cycle analysis; Machine learning; Transformer,"P.

Improving the methods of estimating the insulation aging of the oil-immersed power transformer windings is an urgent task for transformer condition monitoring systems. The scientific novelty of the work is to take into account the uneven distribution of temperature and humidity along the vertical axis of the winding in modeling the aging of insulation and to develop methods for determining the conditions under which the aging rate of insulation in the intermediate layer will exceed aging rate in the hottest layer. The purpose of the work is to evaluate the wear unevenness of cellulose insulation based on modeling the distribution of temperature and humidity along the vertical axis of the power transformer winding. Methods. The transformer winding is mentally divided into horizontal layers of equal height, the reduction of service life is calculated in parallel for all horizontal layers. Layer with the maximum degree of aging for the entire period of operation and storage of the transformer is recognized as determining the reduction in the service life of the insulation of the transformer as a whole. A model of the interaction of winding layers is developed, with determination of temperatures, humidity, relative rate of aging of each layer due to temperature and humidity as a function of traditional design parameters such as load, cooling temperature, heat capacity and thermal resistance of transformer. The index of exceeding the aging rate by the layered method in comparison with this rate for the hottest layer is offered. The method of genetic algorithms determines the conditions for obtaining the maximum value of this index. Results. A computer model has been developed to predict the aging of the cellulose insulation of transformer windings. According to the proposed method, a layer with significantly shorter insulation aging time (in the example, time reduced by 39.18 %) than for the upper layer was determined, which confirms the feasibility of layer-by-layer monitoring and modeling of insulation aging processes of power oil-immersed transformer windings.

Discontinuing MO applications in transformers has instigated alarms to dispose of waste transformer oils (wTOs) from in-service/off-service; lack of treatment may predispose a life on earth to put at risk. Oil degradation was studied for waste transformer oils (wTOs) collected from various substations. The contemporary analysis uses magnetic treatment followed by a biopolymer-clay microcomposite, chitosan-activated bentonite composite (C-ABC), as an effective environment-friendly adsorbent. In addition to being biocompatible, the C-ABC composite’s exceptional adsorption ability—boosted active sites and high surface area—restores the dielectric characteristics of wTOs to the maximum extent possible for brand-new transformer oil (fTO). The reclamation strength of the proposed method using the C-ABC microcomposite was compared with the conventional adsorption materials. The interaction between negatively charged chitosan and positively charged activated bentonite shows significant improvement in the dielectric properties of wTOs. The CIE chromaticity coordinates study confirms the removal of polar and non-polar compounds. The dielectric properties and CIE were found to be improved after careful investigation procedures. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy studies were used to examine the elemental analysis of C-ABC before and after mechanochemical synthesis, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to examine the topography of C-ABC. The investigated oils were also subjected to Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis. The statistical studies show that at 50% survival, the treated oils show a dielectric breakdown voltage of 45 kV for wTO3, 42.5 for wTO2, 41.5 for wTO1, and 40 for wTO4. The mathematical models for the investigated oils and their response surface show interactive effects between the process and response variables. Moreover, SWOT analysis shows the various influential factors of the proposed technique with respect to future scope. Hence, this proposed method is environment-friendly, affordable, easily available, cost-effective, and efficient for the remediation of wTOs.

Such diagnostic data is not available for distribution transformers as only meagre attempts are made to accumulate this information. The reason for lack of such attention is attributed to the compromise made to meet financial constraints and cost-cutting measures. It is needless to emphasize the significance of these diagnostic data in evading premature failures and enhancing the accuracy of the maintenance program. Overall, the concepts of diagnostic methods are well defined regarding power transformers, but cannot be extended to distribution transformers. This paper attempts to fill this gap by measuring the diagnostic data from in-service and defective distribution transformers. For this purpose, eight transformers (six in-service, two defective) showing deviations in their diagnostic status were selected from a group. As per their kVA rating and operating status, the chosen transformers were categorized into three sets and their integrity of insulation and winding-core arrangement were analyzed. Later, the root-cause analysis was performed on defective transformers to understand their failure reasons and possibilities to evade them. The pertinent data obtained are quite valuable for making decisions regarding reliability-oriented maintenance and for extending its potential in the distributed generation. © 2021 by the author.

Among critical electrical assets, the power transformer is probably the most representative. This paper presents a novel method for estimating a risk index for power transformers. The proposed method is based on three Fuzzy Inference Systems (FIS), aimed to integrate expert criteria for the creation of rules and the definition of the membership functions of the entries. The first FIS is dedicated to the calculation of a transformer Health Index (HI), based on the results of the physical-chemical tests normally performed on the insulating liquid of the units. The second FIS is oriented to the determination of a Consequence Factor (CF) of the final failure of the power transformer, and it is determined considering aspects such as overload to other assets, average load supplied by the unit, critical loads supplied, oil volume, proximity to other buildings and penalties for the unavailability of the asset. The last FIS combines the results of the previous FIS, i.e., HI and CF, to provide an estimation of the transformer risk index. The methodology has been designed to perform management of power transformer fleets by allowing decisions to be made, regarding investments, based on risk assessment. The proposal has been tested on a fleet of 15 units. Obtained results show that the FIS for combining HI and the CF leads to more consistent risk indexes, than those obtained when performing the conventional operation of multiplication between HI and FC. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Asset management; Electric transformer testing; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy systems; Health risks; Membership functions; Oil filled transformers; Power transformers; Risk perception; Assets management; Consequence factor; Decisions makings; Fuzzy inference systems; Fuzzy inferencer; Health indices; Keypoints; Power system operators; Risk indices; Risks assessments; Risk assessment,Asset management; Consequence factor; Decision making; Fuzzy inference system; Health index; Risk assessment,"J.

DGA is a reliable diagnostic tool used in power transformers to detect incipient faults developing inside the transformer. The detection of incipient faults enables early scheduling of preventative maintenance and hence prevention of transformer damage. Recently, natural ester oils have been introduced to power transformers as an alternative oil. The application of natural ester oils in power transformers requires a guideline for the application of DGA in this type of oil. The creepage discharges are generated by applying 28 kV to a needle-plane configuration configured at an acute angle. The dissolved gases result reveal that similar gases are generated in the ester and mineral oil while the quantity of dissolved gases is high in the ester oil than the mineral oil. The key dissolved gas was found to be hydrogen. The Duval's triangle and the IEEE key gas diagnostic technique correctly identify the fault while the IEC 60599 fails to identify the fault.

In this paper machine learning algorithms, i.e., nonlinear autoregressive neural networks and support vector machines, are proposed to model the transformer thermal behavior for the purpose of monitoring. The thermal models are developed based on the historical measurements from nine transformers comprised of two 180-MVA units, four 240-MVA units and three 1000-MVA units. The data consist of load profile, tap position, winding indicator temperature (WTI) measurement, ambient temperature, wind speed and solar radiation. The results are validated against field measurements, and it is clearly demonstrated that the alternative algorithms surpass the IEEE Annex G thermal model. An incipient thermal fault identification algorithm is then proposed and successfully used to identify an issue using measurements taken in the field.

PD is one of the most important parameters of PT to ensures the reliability and quality of the PT's operation PT. As PT is one of the most important parts in electrical power system, PD becomes one of the key performance indicators for PT. The quality of manufacturing process of both liquid and solid insulations will reflect to the PD value of PT. Both solid and liquid insulation will form the overall insulation of integration of PT. One of the important manufacturing processes is vacuum and oil impregnation process. These processes ensure the removal of the moisture from PT insulation and keep maintaining PT from moisture ingress. In this study, the experiment is conducted to investigate the relation between vacuum and impregnation process duration to partial discharge value of 167 MVA 500/150 kV on single phase power transformer. Twelve (12) samples are investigated during manufacturing process and final acceptance testing by measuring vacuum and impregnation process duration as well as the value of partial discharge. The result shows that vacuum process duration has significant effect to PD values. Combined with oil impregnation process of the insulation, the results show that to achieve PD below 70pC (<70pC), the optimum vacuum duration is 57 hours and the oil impregnation duration is ranged 75-120 hours. This practical study is beneficial for both the owner and the manufacturer of PT, so it gives the optimum duration for manufacturing process to get lower partial discharge at optimum duration and cost. © 2019 IEEE.",Acceptance tests; Benchmarking; Electric power systems; Impregnation; Insulation; Moisture; Oil filled transformers; Power transformers; Well testing; Acceptance testing; Electrical power system; Impregnation process; Key performance indicators; Manufacturing process; Oil immersed power transformer; Oil impregnation; Vacuum process; Partial discharges,manufacturing process; oil impregnation; partial discharge; power transformer; vacuum process,"C.

With the rapidly increase of the electric consumption and load capacity of the transformer, high hot-spot temperature has become one of the essential issues concerned by engineering manufacturers. The driven force of oil flow is thermal buoyancy in transformer for Oil Natural /Air Forced (ONAF) cooling mode, besides, the internal oil flow paths are complex. Therefore, the heat dissipation for ONAF transformers becomes a key index determining the loading power, and it is of great theoretical and practical significance to study the oil flow distribution and temperature field. In this paper, the finite volume method is used to simulate the temperature and flow fields of a 110 kV ONAF transformer. The results show that the temperature inside transformer increases gradually with the height, and the hot-spot is found located below the low-voltage winding top. The velocity of oil in the vertical oil channels are greater than the horizontal oil channels between the coil discs. It is found that introducing washers in the transformer design can enhance the flow rate of horizontal oil channels and strengthening the heat dissipation of windings. The research results can be used to guide the evaluation of load capacity and the heat dissipation structure design of the transformer.  © 2021 IEEE.",Domestic appliances; Electric power transmission networks; Finite volume method; Flow fields; Oil filled transformers; Transformer windings; Winding; Load capacity; Natural air; Oil flow; Oil immersed transformers; Oil naturals; Simulation; Steady-state simulations; Temperature field; Transformer; Voltage levels; Temperature,Flow field; Simulation; Temperature field; Transformer; Washers,"C.

In this context, this paper proposes a new multi-objective optimization algorithm in order to reduce the mentioned problems. At the same time, users’ interests in terms of charging cost and privacy have been taken into account. The proposed multi-objective optimization is based on minimizing the load variance and charging costs by using the weighted sum method and fuzzy control. The use of vehicle to grid (V2G) concept and load forecast uncertainties have been also considered. Furthermore, an innovative method for mitigating voltage unbalances has been developed. The effectiveness of this methodology has been tested using real data of a LV distribution network, located in Borup (Denmark).

It is of great importance to determine the transformer state and take countermeasures in advance. Dissolved gas analysis (DGA) is one of the most common methods for state evaluation of the oil-immersed transformer. Therefore, a time series forecasting model based on Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model is presented to forecast the dissolved gas concentration in transformer oil in this paper. Firstly, the influence of the period parameter on the prediction effect and the correlation between the ambient temperature and the gas concentration are analyzed. Then, comparing the prediction results of the autoregressive (AR) model, the long short-term memory (LSTM) model and the SARIMA model on the trend component of the gas, it is found that the SARIMA model has the most accurate and stable performance. And the accuracy of the prediction results is higher when the external factors related to the prediction data are considered in the SARIMA model. Finally, the reliability of the SARIMA model for the recent prediction on actual data is verified.

Monitoring of hot spot temperature is important to ensure safe operation of the transformer. In order to realize accurate monitoring on winding temperature, the paper presents a distributed temperature measurement system for power transformer based on fiber Bragg grating (FBG). Firstly, the principle of the FBG temperature measurement is introduced. Then, temperature distribution of a 10 kV distribution transformer is simulated based on finite element simulation method. Hot spot locations of the windings are obtained. After that, the manufacturing techniques are improved, and a distribution transformer prototype with FBGs is developed. Finally, temperature rise tests under the rated load are carried out to investigate the efficient of the proposed system.

A simulation study is conducted across a range of scenarios and prototypical distribution networks. Network constraint violations, such as over-voltages and blown fuses, are recorded and compared to a no-control baseline simulation. Notably, the simulation results show that no instantaneous constraints are violated due to load control. We find that the mean aging rate of the transformers decreases in 24 of 25 simulations, though in 21 simulations a majority of transformers experience increased aging rates. Overall the results indicate that load control for balancing services is unlikely to cause emergency-level issues on a distribution network. However, longer term impacts, such as increased aging of certain transformers, may warrant a control design that manages particular network constraints. © 2017 IEEE.",Ancillary service; Control design; Network constraints; Over-voltages; Physical constraints; Simulation studies; Thermostatically controlled loads; transformer; Electric power distribution,ancillary services; Distribution network; thermostatically controlled loads; transformer,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-150904237-1,,,English,"IEEE Manch.

In this study, an intelligent algorithm employing particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been used to get the optimum T-joint design of a core in a three-phase transformer. This technique was employed to design a new geometry of a joint to obtain the minimum loss in a three-phase transformer. In achieving this target, a 3D finite element method had been used to simulate the proposed transformer model. Power losses in the core and winding losses had been considered as the heat sources, and the results were validated based on the test data obtained from transformer factory. The results presented that the total losses have been decreased up to 10% compared to the corresponding values from common designs. Moreover, the core losses have been reduced in the range of 11% compared to similar parameters in the conventional design. © 2019 IEEE.",Electric windings; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Power control; 3-D finite element method; Conventional design; Core and windings; Heat sources; Intelligent Algorithms; Optimization techniques; Three-phase transformers; Transformer modeling; Electric transformer testing,Finite element methods; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Power transformer; Transformer core losses,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-172810781-3,,,English,"Int.

Although the electrification of transportation offers power utilities the opportunity to increase total load served in an era of flat year-over-year electricity sales, the sustainable integration of PEVs over the long term requires improved understanding of overload risks on existing power distribution systems. In this context, we propose a probabilistic model to study the impacts of residential PEV charging load on distribution systems. More specifically, the proposed model captures the uncertainty of PEV charging load and the uncertainty of residential customer load through Poisson and Gaussian distribution models respectively. These models are then utilized in a Monte Carlo simulation approach to calculate the statistical significance of resulting total load profiles and ultimately quantify the overloading risk levels on distribution transformers.

The non-linear electrical loads are increasing, mainly in the electrical distribution system, and the electrical power transformer is inserted in this scenario, supplying these loads. Consequently, the increasing non-linear loads affect the electrical transformers and their factors directly, like in the dependency between temperature and harmonic increase. Therefore, to study the influence of harmonics in the transformer's temperature, one should understand how it will behave with these changes in the electrical power system. For this reason, in this article, numeric simulations and tests were performed to predict the transformer temperature behavior. The proposal is a numeric technique for coupling two equations, thermal and electromagnetic, of an electrical transformer, considering heat sources regarding joule, eddy current, and hysteresis effect. To evaluate the numeric simulation and understanding the electrical transformer behavior in real-life, tests with specific harmonic orders (3rd, 5th, and 7th) and their combinations and a test with less than 10% total harmonic distortion, according to IEEE 519 standard were performed. It is verified that the electrical transformer temperature rises with the increase in harmonic amplitude and its orders. Results show that the industry must be aware of the effects of the increasing non-linear loads when designing the next generation of transformers concerning their durability and lifetime. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020.",Eddy current testing; Electric transformer testing; Harmonic analysis; Hysteresis; Power transformers; Electrical distribution system; Electrical power system; Electrical transformers; Harmonic amplitude; Ieee 519 standards; Specific harmonics; Temperature behavior; Total harmonic distortion (THD); Electric loads,Harmonic analysis; Power transformer; Thermal analysis; Total harmonic distortion,"M.Z.

In this respect, Photovoltaic (PV) power plants have become more important in recent years and renewable energy sources integrated into the power system are increasing day by day. Transformers are the main components of electrical grids and are widely used in renewable power plants to transfer the energy they produce to the grid. Accordingly, transformers are one of the most critical equipment of PV plants, and their safe operation and stability in the electrical network are important. This type of transformer is supplied from solar panels through inverters and needs to be customized to work with each system. In this type of transformer, the losses are higher than those for transformers used in electrical power systems supplied by sinusoidal voltage considering existence of different voltage and current harmonics content produced by the inverter. In this study, a special type of PV transformer was designed in accordance with the target performance criteria, taking into account the effects of harmonics, and keeping the transformer losses and temperature rise at a safe level.

A prevalent method employed in the preventive maintenance and assessment of the health index of transformers is the Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA). A contemporary trend is to utilize an online DGA monitoring instrument while carrying on to conduct investigations in the test laboratory. Most recently, the testing of stray gassing has only been conducted by oil suppliers. With the sharp increase in reports of peculiar stray gassing phenomena in relatively new transformers, typically not more than ten years in-service, transformer manufactures and utility owners began conducting this test in-house. Though an established testing procedure for stray gassing exists, there is still lack of coherent criterion on the stray gassing limits and appropriate period when stray gassing patterns should be a concern. In this paper, numerous DGA methods have been adopted to analyze the oil sample results of a 2000kVA transformer in-service that has been exhibiting stray gassing patterns. The objective of this paper is to distinguish the stray gassing phenomena of uninhibited mineral oil so that they are unambiguous from other occurring fault types. A wide-scale study on transformers filled with uninhibited mineral oils has been carried out to develop local stray gassing limits for transformers in the South African power grid, specifically in solar photovoltaic (PV) plants. Premier findings indicate that the Hydrogen gas constituted by stray gassing is often misinterpreted to corona partial discharges in the transformers. © 2021 IEEE.",Electric power transmission networks; Gas oils; Health; Health risks; Mineral oils; Oil filled transformers; Partial discharges; Power transformers; Solar power generation; Case-studies; Dissolved gas analyse; Dissolved gases analysis; Health indices; Monitoring instruments; Oil suppliers; Online dissolved gas analysis; Sharp increase; Stray gassing; Transformer; Preventive maintenance,Dissolved gas analysis (DGA); Health index; Stray gassing; Transformer,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-166540311-5,,,English,"IEEE PES/IAS PowerAfrica, PowerAfrica",Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85116658854

The SVR algorithm is based on the statistical learning theory and is part of the machine learning tools. It was used through a six stage implementation where an SVR model capable of estimating the variable under study is obtained. The method was applied to a real 30 MVA transformer with ONAN/ONAF cooling at 70/100 % of load using a database for a 10 year period. The developed SVR model was validated by comparison to the results obtained with the Dejan Susa model using statistical performance metrics. In conclusion, the results obtained indicate that the implemented SVR model allows estimating the hot spot temperature with high accuracy. © 2020 Centro de Informacion Tecnologica.

It is not sensible to directly create the detailed laminations of a transformer core for analyzing the eddy-current field because of sophisticated modeling procedure and incredible computational cost. As a result, in this article, a series of original formulas to describe the equivalent electromagnetic parameters of multilevel-circle-section wound core under various frequencies, including anisotropic conductivity and permeability, are proposed to serve for finite-element analysis, on which the core model is considered to be a continuum with homogeneous material property. The experiment of core losses on practical wound core with the characteristic of multilevel-circle section is taken to verify the availability of the proposed model, where the modified extrapolation method is applied to obtain the eddy-current components separated from total core losses. Finally, there are satisfactory precisions on simulated results of eddy-current losses at a wide range of frequency and magnetic flux density; hence, this homogenization method is effectively applicable for engineering.

This paper proposes a method for evaluating the performance of transformer windings in order to improve the overall effectiveness of a winding evaluation. The index data obtained based on a short-circuit impedance method, frequency response method, and oscillation wave method are used in the algorithm proposed in this paper. First, the transformer winding performance evaluation index system is constructed. Second, the weight of each index is determined by analytic hierarchy process, and then the fuzzy comprehensive assessment method is introduced, and the fuzzy evaluation matrix is established, the evaluation results are calculated using the evaluation formula. Finally, the maximum membership principle is used to determine the performance level of the transformer winding on the evaluation results, and the evaluation results of the transformer winding state are obtained. The example shows that the evaluation level of the measured transformer winding performance can be obtained by this method as “good”.

In this paper, a practical distribution system with installed rooftop solar photo-voltaic (PV) units is considered for investigation. Total study periods has been divided into three parts. The benefits of PV in terms of the life of the transformers have been quantified for the each part.

This is due to technical impacts caused by such LZC technologies on voltage quality, such as voltage rise, voltage drop, voltage unbalance, and on assets loading (transformer and conductors). This paper proposes a stochastic approach based on Monte Carlo simulations to estimate combined PV-PEV hosting capacity in LV networks. In addition, the proposed approach can be used to assist utility engineers to undertake planning actions based on the potential risk of violation. From the results obtained by applying the proposed approach to a real Brazilian LV network, overvoltage and unbalance voltage issues are found to be the most limiting factors of combined PV-PEV connections. Further, it is shown that the combined PV-PEV penetration levels need to be considered to avoid under or overestimations of both PV and PEV hosting capacity. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Charging (batteries); Electric power distribution; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Stochastic systems; Voltage distribution measurement; Capacity analysis; Combined photovoltaic-plug-in electric vehicle penetration; Hosting capacity; Hosting capacity analyse; Low carbon; Low voltage distribution network; Photovoltaics; Plug-in electric vehicle charging; Rooftop photovoltaic systems; Vehicle penetration; Plug-in electric vehicles,Combined PV-PEV penetration; Hosting capacity analysis; Low-voltage (LV) distribution networks; Plug-in electric vehicles (PEV) charging; Rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems,"L.E.S. e Silva; Federal University of Amazonas, Manaus, Brazil; email: eduardosales@ufam.edu.br",,Elsevier Ltd,03787796,,EPSRD,,English,Electr Power Syst Res,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123756671

The incipient faults that are originally self-cleaning faults may repeatedly occur and gradually develop to a permanent fault after its first occurrence. The incipient fault detection is considered as a crucial task in predictive maintenance for power equipment, such as transformers, circuit breakers, and underground cables. This paper proposes a hybrid method for incipient faults detection and classification. The proposed method firstladopts two extraction methods and two feature measures to obtain seven peculiar features from voltage waveforms of abnormal phases recorded by power quality monitors at substations in a transmission network. Then, a feature selection method and the support vector machine combined with particle swarm optimization are applied to classify various types of incipient faults.

However, the increased penetration of EVs in the global transportation market has led increased electricity demands, which is expected to affect the operation of energy distribution systems. In the present paper, a demonstration about the effects of uncontrolled EVs charging in a case study low voltage (LV) network is demonstrated and a fuzzy energy management strategy for the coordination of EV charging in LV networks is presented, by including the distance of the EVs from the transformers in the fuzzy management systems for the first time. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) European Test Feeder is used as a case study low voltage distribution grid. In particular, the developed system configuration takes into consideration the architecture of the grid, the ampacities of the lines and the voltages at the system’s buses. Moreover, electric vehicles are considered as agent-based models, which are characterized by the model of each EV, the state-of-charge of their batteries and the charging power. In particular, an investigation into the effects of uncontrolled charging is performed, in which two approaches are examined. The first approach investigates the maximum number of chargeable EVs in the case study network and how it is influenced by the grid’s household loads. The second approach examines the number of network undervoltages and lines ampacity violations in a set of simulation scenarios. The results of the first approach show that the distance of the EVs from the networks substation affects the maximum number of chargeable EVs in a significant manner. Based on the observed results of the two approaches, a fuzzy management system is designed for the coordination of EV changing, which takes into account the distance from the EV charging points to the feeder substation, the state-of-charge of the EVs’ batteries and the EVs’ charging delay time. © 2020 by the authors.

However, interpretation schemes are still challenging. Studies show that FRA data can be influenced by parameters other than winding deformation, including temperature. In this study, a machine-learning approach with temperature as an input attribute was used to objectively identify faults in FRA traces. To the best knowledge of the authors, this has not been reported in the literature. A single-phase transformer model was specifically designed and fabricated for use as a test object for the study. The model is unique in that it allows the non-destructive interchange of healthy and distorted winding sections and, hence, reproducible and repeatable FRA measurements. FRA measurements taken at temperatures ranging from −40◦ C to 40◦ C were used first to describe the impact of temperature on FRA traces and then to test the ability of the machine learning algorithms to discriminate between fault conditions and temperature variation. The results show that when temperature is not considered in the training dataset, the algorithm may misclassify healthy measurements, taken at different temperatures, as mechanical or electrical faults. However, once the influence of temperature was considered in the training set, the performance of the classifier as studied was restored. The results indicate the feasibility of using the proposed approach to prevent misclassification based on temperature changes. © 2021 by the authors.

Turn-to-turn faults between two parallel conductors have been taken into account, since they are the most difficult to detect due to the smallest short-circuit current level, especially when they are located close to the middle of the coil. Generally, standard differential protection relays fail in such a case, when low number of turns are shorted. Therefore, a new method was proposed here that is based on the combination of the negative-sequence current integral criterion and the unique differential quantities. The sensitivity and security of the presented method are analyzed and discussed. The performance of the proposed algorithm and three other commonly used methods have been tested with the signals generated using the MATLAB/Simulink program.

Therefore, the discrimination between the inrush currents and faults is very important. A new technique is proposed in this paper to distinguish the internal fault of transformers and other normal transient conditions (such as inrush current). Accordingly, a new operational characteristic is defined for feature extraction and classification of the instantaneous current behavior based on the modal transform. The internal fault current is accurately and rapidly discriminated from the other transient current conditions (such as load switching, and inrush currents) by tracking the differential current curve. Furthermore, the real transformer is simulated to validate the proposed method by the PSCAD-EMTDC and MATLAB software. Furthermore, the real data of the actual fault in the transformer of the Iranian power network is studied. The simulation results show the stability, reliability, simplicity, and high speed of the proposed method in the discrimination of the fault current from inrush current. The method is compared with its other intelligent counterparts and the results confirm a clear improvement. © 2021",Electric fault currents; Electric power system protection; MATLAB; Power quality; Transformer protection; 'current; Differential protection; In-rush current; Inrush fault; Internal faults; Operational characteristics; Performance; Performance characteristics; Protection relay; Transient conditions; Power transformers,Differential protection; Inrush current; Performance characteristic; Power transformer,"H.R.

The insertion of PEV5 in households will facilitate the use of renewable sources and possibly create economic benefits to users, as shown in a Mexican example here presented, but also will introduce some challenges such as how the penetration of PEVs affect the quality of existing power grids. The contribution of this work is to review the literature in reference to the power quality problems and to test them in a real distribution system based on the Mueller community in Austin, Texas that has PEV5 and photovoltaic panels (PVs). The results show that a coordinated delay charge mode reduces the loading on transformers at peak hours and improves voltage regulation. Additionally, it is shown that photovoltaic panels introduce a power factor reduction during daytime in the main feeder. Corrective measures should be considered for high levels of PV penetration, such as reactive power support, VAr compensators or community energy storage, which can be presented as one potential solution to most of the problems listed in current literature. However, more research needs to be done in a much broader scale because power systems differ from each other and between countries, but there is a consensus that high power demand by PEV5 leads to voltage statutory violations at some points in the grid and smart charging is required to operate the system efficiently. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this respect, smart households have drawn significant attention recently. Home energy management systems (HEMS) in smart households and transformer energy management units have different objectives that can sometimes be conflicting. Thus, a novel interactive optimum operating strategy that considers all possible aspects in each smart household together with internal bi-directional power flows within the household structure from economic (minimization of household daily electricity usage costs) and technical (avoidance of transformer overloading) perspective is proposed in this study. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first study in the literature combining all of the possible operational possibilities in HEMS of smart households together with internal household bi-directional power flows and the technical limitations of a transformer unit serving a neighborhood of smart households under a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) framework. © 2015 IEEE.",Distributed power generation; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Energy management; Integer programming; Coordination strategy; Home energy management systems; Household structures; Mixed-integer linear programming; Operating strategy; smart neighborhood; Technical limitations; Transformer overloading; Energy management systems,Distributed generation; electric vehicles; home energy management system; smart neighborhood,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-147997693-5,,,English,"IEEE Eindh.

In this paper, PHEV charging strategy namely SOC-based charging has been proposed. This charging strategy focused on user needs, i.e. full charged the battery within plugged-in time frame considering maximum charging rate from the standard outlet. Moreover, it will reduce the peak loads as well as improving the load factor on a power system network. Real vehicle travel data from National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) is used to represent PHEV types, miles driven and its final arriving times. This proposed technique also comprehensively used to present the impact of charging PHEV on power system networks considering PHEV battery sizes and maximum charging levels. Vehicles Charging Load Profile (VCLP) is developed and implemented in IEEE 30-bus test system that represents a portion of American Electric Power System (Midwestern US). Normalization technique is used to represent real time loads of IEEE 30-bus test system. Comparative study has been performed with respect to uncontrolled charging technique. Results indicated that the proposed charging strategy not only achieved the required battery capacity but also has improved peak load and load factor thus reduces impacts on power system networks. © 2014 IEEE.",Electric power systems; Energy conversion; Motor transportation; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; Secondary batteries; American electric power; Charging load profiles; Electricity demands; Load profiles; National household travel surveys; Plug in hybrid electric vehicles; Transportation electrifications; Uncontrolled charging; Charging (batteries),electricity demands profile; impact of PHEV charging; load profile; Plug-in Hybrid-Electric Vehicle; transportation electrification,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-147994848-2,,,English,"IEEE Conf.

Electrical vehicles (EVs) can help to de-carbonise the environment, but a downside is the technical issues presented to the low-voltage distribution network. To quantify the stochastic nature of transport-affected electrification, probabilistic load flow is employed. Monte Carlo-based simulation is applied to accommodate the probabilistic uncertainties associated with variable EV charging patterns. This study considers high-power charging (up to 11 kW) at the domestic level while monitoring power quality variations (voltage drop, voltage unbalance factor, voltage sag) standards. This work focuses on the Irish and UK, distribution system operator's–transmission system operator's perspectives, as it will help to identify the likely impacts due to high-EV charger proliferation at household locations. The results indicate that if a 3.68 kW charger is used at the domestic level, it is possible for 40% of total household consumers to connect EVs directly to the distribution network without any power quality breaches. Furthermore, the proliferation of EV can be increased up to 100% if constrained to the start, and middle portions of the network (relative to the feeder substation transformer). For higher charger capacities (up to 11 kW), a bottleneck is presented regarding a resultant voltage unbalance factor. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2020",Binary alloys; Charging (batteries); Electric load flow; Electric utilities; Monte Carlo methods; Potassium alloys; Power quality; Stochastic systems; Sustainable development; Transformer substations; Uranium alloys; Voltage control; Voltage distribution measurement; Low voltage distribution network; Power quality variations; Probabilistic load flow; Probabilistic uncertainty; Substation transformers; Transmission system operators; Transportation system; Voltage unbalance factors; Electric power transmission,,"A.

Specifically, we assess the prevalence of distribution network constraint violations, such as over- or under-voltages and overloading of transformers. Our goal is to determine the set of constraints that are at increased risk of being violated when TCLs provide regulation. We compare network operation in two cases: first, with TCLs operating freely; and second, with TCLs controlled to track a regulation signal. Using GridLAB-D, we run power flow simulations of five real distribution networks. Our results indicate that voltage limits are at increased risk of violation when TCLs provide regulation because of increased voltage variation. Effects on transformer aging are more nuanced and depend on the method used for dispatching TCLs. Overall, we find that, for the networks studied, the set of constraints at risk of violation is a small subset of all network constraints. Therefore, network-protecting load control algorithms may only need to consider a small set of constraints, enhancing their computational efficiency. © 1969-2012 IEEE.",Aging of materials; Computational efficiency; Electric frequency control; Electric instrument transformers; Electric load flow; Electric load management; Electric power systems; Electric transformers; Energy resources; Power transformers; Switches; Atmospheric model; Distributed Energy Resources; Distribution operations; Frequency regulations; Load modeling; Thermostatically controlled loads; Electric power distribution,distributed energy resources; distribution network; distribution operation; frequency regulation; Thermostatically controlled loads; transformers,"S.C.

Although time-varying electricity price, demand response, and incentive programs are suggested in many papers as solutions to smooth the peak-load, the results are not satisfactory. For example, in the presence of a dynamic price, all PEVs at homes tend to charge during periods when the electricity price is low. They may create peak demands that exceed the transformer power limit in unexpected periods when the power consumption is low. The situation gets worse when a fixed price is used in some countries and regions. PEVs tend to charge at any time without considering the presence or not of a peak load. To solve the problem of high penetration level of PEVs, we propose three novel contributions as follows, (i) a novel power Soft-Constraint at home level, (ii) a novel Multilevel Power-based Soft-Constraint, and (iii) a new Multilevel Power-based Electricity Tariff System are proposed. Simulation results show that our approach improves the integration of PEVs even when high penetration level is considered and even when fixed electricity price is used. © 2018 IEEE.",Developing countries; Electric power distribution; Electric vehicles; Demand response programs; Distribution systems; Electricity prices; Electricity tariff; Incentive programs; Penetration level; Time-varying electricity prices; Transformer power; Plug-in electric vehicles,Demand response program; Distribution Network; Electric Vehicle; High penetration level of PEVs; Time-varying electricity price,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-153864665-6,,,English,"Int.

This allows customers to use a lower voltage. In the electrical industry, distribution transformers are more expensive, and as such, this paper describes a system that monitors the various characteristics of distribution transformers. A central unit, RTU, and remote terminal unit (RTU) are two units of equipment that are quite distinct. This work describes an embedded system for monitoring and recording critical distribution transformer's operation characteristics such as load current, voltage imbalance, transformer oil level rise or fall, and temperature level. A standalone single-chip microprocessor and sensor packages are integrated into the proposed monitoring system. It is situated near the distribution transformer and records the above-mentioned parameters. The parameter values obtained are processed and saved in the system memory. This method will assist utilities in making the best use of transformers and detecting problems before they become disastrous. The above values are updated on the web page so that they can be monitored from any place. An alternate distribution transformer is used as an additional power source when the present distribution transformer fails. This system also sends a warning message to the person in charge when an abnormality occurs in the transformer. The switching process is controlled by using Internet of Things (IoT) technology. This system helps to increase the health of the transformer. © 2021 IEEE.",Internet of things; Oil filled transformers; Websites; Central units; Distribution transformer; Electrical distribution; Electrical industry; Electrical transmission; Industry distributions; Low voltages; Raspberry pi; Remote terminal units; Transformer monitoring system; Monitoring,Distribution transformer; Internet of Things; Monitoring; Raspberry pi; RTU,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-166542691-6,,,English,"IEEE Int.

An experimental investigation is conducted on the activity of PDs and their inception voltage in mineral oil (MO) and palm kernel oil methyl ester (PKOME). This is done by using the analysis of the phase-resolved partial discharge patterns model and the Weibull distribution. The experimental set-up consists of a 220 V/50 kV high voltage transformer, a control box and a test cell containing four electrode configurations. The tests are conducted according to the IEC 61,294 for the determination of partial discharge inception voltage. The experimental results show that the characteristics of a Rogowski coil have a considerable effect on the waveform and the number of occurrences of detected discharges. The number of occurrences of discharges detected with the shunt sensor is reduced by almost 50% compared to those of a Rogowski sensor. The parameters obtained from the Weibull distribution show that PKOME has a higher resistance to discharge inception than MO. © 2022",Electric transformer testing; Esters; Minerals; Oil filled transformers; Palm oil; Partial discharges; Power transformers; Weibull distribution; Experimental investigations; Experimental set up; Inception voltages; Methyl esters; Palm kernel oil; Palm kernel oil methyl ester; Partial discharge activity; Phase resolved partial discharge patterns; Rogowski Coil; Shunt sensor; Mineral oils,Mineral oil; Palm kernel oil methyl ester; Partial discharges; Rogowski coil; Shunt sensor,"G.M.

One of the key components to be impacted is the power transformer at the substation. In this paper, we aim to evaluate the impact of high penetration PV on the lifetime of the substation power transformer. At moderate levels of PV penetration, the loading on the substation transformer decreases, and therefore this will help to prolong the lifetime of the transformer. To estimate this expected benefit, a thermal model for the transformer is used to estimate its hot spot temperature as this temperature is the main factor affecting the degradation of the transformer under normal loading conditions. To illustrate the method, a case study is given. A 10-year period is considered for transformer loss of life evaluation, where practical load growth and PV penetration scenarios are considered. The simulation is carried out on a 15 MVA transformer in the IEEE 123 bus system. Simulation results show that PV penetrations below 100% indeed prolong the transformer lifetime. However, the saved transformer lifetime is not considerable compared to the total transformer lifespan. © 2021 IEEE.",Thermography (temperature measurement); Distribution systems; Hotspot temperature; Hottest-spot temperatures; Loss of life; Photovoltaic penetration; Photovoltaic systems; Photovoltaics; Power transformer loss; Thermal model; Transformer loss of lives; Power transformers,Hot spot temperature; loss of life; power transformer; PV penetration; thermal model,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-166544875-8,,,English,"Proc.

In order to fully exploit and utilize the load capacity of transformer, a novel improved model is proposed based on the principle of thermal- electric analogy. Firstly, solar radiation is introduced as a new heat source, and the thermal conductance is modified by considering the effect of temperature on oil viscosity. Then, a transformer load capacity evaluation model based on the thermal-electric analogy principle is proposed under the constraint conditions of top-oil temperature, hot-spot temperature, relative life loss, and auxiliary equipment capacity level. Finally, a 50 MVA transformer is carried out for oil temperature and load capacity. The results demonstrate that compared with Tang-model and the transformer guidelines, the error of the top-oil temperature and the hot-spot temperature of the new model is smaller. In addition, for periodic loads, transformer load capacity also represents different characteristics, which provides a guide for exploiting the load potential of power transformers. © 2021 IEEE.",Auxiliary equipment; Electric losses; Oil filled transformers; Power transformers; Constraint conditions; Effect of temperature; Hotspot temperature; Oil immersed transformers; Power system operations; Thermal conductance; Top oil temperature; Transformer-load; Electric transformer loads,hot-spot temperature; load capacity; relative life loss; thermal-electric analogy,,Lie T.-T.; Liu Y.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-172819159-1,,,English,"Proc. - Asia Conf.

Different types of control strategies are being developed to tackle the challenges with direct switching actions such as load shedding or power curtailment. Alternatively, demand flexibility from the large number of DERs is being considered as a potential approach by influencing the individual end-users with various demand response (DR) programs. However, most of the DR-based solutions focus on scheduling phase, thus having a limitation to handle network issues in real-time grid operation. In order to improve DR's capability, besides a proper incentive scheme for involved actors, the DR-based approach needs to integrate network constraints and quantify this real-time information in its control process. In this paper, a novel method for real-time congestion management is proposed, which focuses on resolving the congestion problem at the MV/LV transformer. Detail models for different loads and thermal overloading of the MV/LV transformer are developed to realize the benefits of the demand flexibility. The overall performance of the integrated approach for the congestion management has been verified by a simulation with a typical LV network of the Netherlands. © 2016 Power Systems Computation Conference.",Electric power distribution; Energy resources; Traffic congestion; Active distribution networks; Congestion management; Demand response programs; Distributed Energy Resources; Graceful degradation; Low-voltage distributions; Real-time information; thermal overloading; Electric load shedding,Congestion management; graceful degradation; overloading cost; thermal overloading,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-889410512-4,,,English,"Power Syst.

First, using three BEB concepts: flash, opportunity, and overnight, a real-time simulation model is developed for a full transit BEBs operation in order to (1) quantify the energy demands, (2) design the required infrastructure of the charging station, (3) test the transit operation feasibility, and (4) generate the charging load profile. Simulation results show that flash and opportunity BEBs are more feasible for full transit BEBs operation, however they suffer from high and intermittent power demands. Second, the generated charging load profile for each BEB operation is utilized to study its impact on the utilization and lifetime of the transformers, and the operation of the local distribution grid. Results indicate that the operation of overnight electric buses is more feasible as it relates to their impacts on the substation transformer and distribution feeders overloading, voltage regulation and quality aspects, and operation of voltage control devices. Collectively, findings from this study highlight that the selection of BEBs in a full network transit operation hinges on achieving feasible operation while reducing impacts on utility grid. Insights derived from this work can help optimize the implementation of BEBs in transit context. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Battery electric vehicles; Charging (batteries); Electric automobiles; Electric substations; Quality control; Transformer substations; Voltage regulators; Electric bus; Energy demands; Grid impact analysis; Operational feasibility; Transit networks; Electric power transmission networks,Battery electric bus; Energy demands; Full transit network simulation; Grid impact analysis; Operational feasibility,"M.

The considerable growth in the deployment of solar photovoltaic plants has grabbed the attention of worldwide project developers, investors and stakeholders. In the way indicated, more devised efforts are essential to wield the guarantee that solar photovoltaic plant equipment operate to meet the requirement of solar photovoltaic environment and facilitate the generation of energy as required. One such equipment susceptible to the harmonics and distortion generated by the connected inverters and resonances due to the non-linear loads is the step-up transformer. Harmonics and distortion are well known to introduce additional losses, hotspot temperature rise and reduction of the transformer service life. The rise in hotspot temperature yield abnormal levels of ignitable gases in the step-up transformer oil such that untimely failures may take place. The concentration of this gases suggests partial discharge and excessive heating. Recently reported studies evoke that the designing of solar photovoltaic plant transformers be more robust. This paper intends to contribute additional knowledge towards understanding the adverse effects related to harmonic currents in the step-up transformer for solar photovoltaic application. The winding eddy losses and structural part losses are examined under a harmonic profile to compute the service losses and resultant thermal requirements. © 2020 IEEE.",Harmonic analysis; Oil filled transformers; Partial discharges; Photovoltaic effects; Solar power plants; Thermal aging; Additional knowledge; Hotspot temperature; Renewable energy source; Solar photovoltaic energies; Solar photovoltaic generations; Solar photovoltaic plants; Step up transformers; Thermal requirements; Solar energy,Harmonics; Hotspot temperature rise and service life; Losses; Solar photovoltaic; Step-up transformer,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-172812956-3,,,English,"IEEE Int.

However, the operation modes of the main transformer unit in PSH are way more complex than the conventional power transformer, which makes the condition monitoring and fault detection of PSH becoming a technical challenge. In this article, an operation status recognition model of main transformers in PSH based on artificial visualization of mechanical vibration signals and deep learning is proposed. The vibration signals on a series of 500 kV/360 MVA main transformers of PSH are monitored periodically by contacting sensor arrays. These vibration signals are processed into nephograms by using linear interpolation fitting and 1D to 2D data mapping. A deep learning method based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to classify nephograms obtained under different operation modes, that is, no load, full load, DC bias, and short circuit. The proposed status prediction algorithm was trained and tested through 150 sets of vibration nephogram samples, which ensures the feasibility of the nephogram generation method and the performance of the classifier. The testing results show that the overall status prediction accuracy for the proposed algorithm achieves 89.7% when the network structure is optimized. It is indicated that the mechanical vibration of the main transformer has a pattern matching relationship with the operating state of PSH. In practice, the operating status of PSH can be diagnosed remotely by embedded IoT sensors; the health index of PSH can also be estimated by weighed analysis of the changing trend of vibration data obtained in the life cycle.

Therefore, accurate modeling of transformers is required for simulation-based analysis with the model. The paper proposes an efficient and straightforward parameter estimation of power transformers based on sweep frequency response analysis (SFRA) test data. The method first develops a transformer model consisting of repetitive RLC sections and mutual inductances and then aligns the simulated SFRA curve with the measured one by adjusting parameters. Note that this adjustment is based on individual parameter impacts on the SFRA curve. After aligning the two curves, the final transformer model can be obtained. In this paper, actual single-phase, three-winding transformer model parameters were estimated based on field SFRA data, showing that SFRA curves simulated from the estimated model are consistent with the measured data. © 2021 by the authors.

The main work nowadays is focused on the rising of the reliability of transformers and lowering power losses. The replacement of new materials instead of conventionally used ones can provide a solution. This procedure can improve factors, like a reduction of power losses, but also influence others normally neglected, like proper work in higher frequencies. The article presents the measurement results of the frequency characteristics of model test coils made with different magnetic materials cores (silicon steel, amorphous material, and nanocrystalline material), the measurements based on the sweep frequency response analysis (SFRA) method used for the determination of chosen frequency characteristics. The analysis presents the impact of different coil deformation levels on frequency characteristics. Results show that the replacement of conventional silicon steel with thinner high permeability materials can modify the state-of-the-art frequency response analysis (FRA) interpretation guidelines. The replacement of a new type of magnetic material as a magnetic core in the existing design of power transformer should lead to a full analysis of its behavior in the high-frequency domain. © 2020 by the author.

Their proper exploitation needs to apply correct and reliable diagnostics, e.g., the use of dielectric response methods, that take into account their specific construction and working conditions. In this article, based on laboratory tests carried out on a real bushing, it has been shown that the significant temperature distribution within its core significantly affects the shape of the dielectric response of its insulation; therefore, the approach to its modeling should be changed. Hence, a new method for interpreting the results, using the so-called the 2XY model, is proposed. Subsequently, based on the measurements made on the insulators in operation, a new modeling method was verified. In conclusion, it can be stated that the 2XY model significantly improves the reliability of the dielectric response analysis, which should be confirmed in the future by tests on withdrawn and revised insulators. © 2021 by the authors.

This model is, essentially, the digital twin of the MV side of the T/F. The method calculates T/F MV waveforms of voltage and current, and active and reactive power as accurately as an instrument T/F, captures all harmonics content, is unaffected by asymmetrical loading and identifies most system faults on the MV side of the T/F.

In many utilities, transformers have been operating for many years past their expected usable life. As power demand has surged, transformers in some areas are being loaded beyond their rated capacity to meet the demand. One of the vital components in a transformer is the on-load tap changer (OLTC), which regulates the voltage in the distribution network. This study aims to review several condition-monitoring techniques (online and offline) that can monitor the health of the OLTC and assure the safety of the transformer’s OLTC from irreparable damage by detecting the defect at an earlier stage, which is preceded by the specification of typical faults. This paper also discussed the common faults of the OLTC and the root causes of these faults. The OLTC is prone to mechanical faults due to its frequently changing mechanism in the tap operation. The OLTC are also prone to oil as well as thermal faults. As a result, it is critical to monitor OLTC conditions while they are in use. Proper management of condition monitoring (CM) for the OLTC is useful and necessary to increase availability and achieve optimised operating. Condition monitoring (CM) and diagnostics methods (DM) have been developing since the 1950s. CM and DM have been implemented to diagnose and detect an incipient fault, especially for the OLTC. Many techniques, online and offline, are being used to monitor the condition of the OLTC to prevent failure and minimize outages. These DM and CM will prolong the operational cycle and avoid a major disaster for the OLTC, which is an unfavorable scenario. © 2022 by the authors.",Damage detection; Disaster prevention; Electric utilities; Outages; Voltage control; Condition; Diagnostic methods; Electricity distribution; Energy; Incipient faults; Monitoring methods; Offline; On-load tap changer; Onload tap changer; Transformer; Condition monitoring,condition monitoring; diagnostic methods; electricity distribution; energy; incipient fault; on-load tap changer (OLTC); transformer,"F.B.

PEVs locally produce zero emissions and they are more efficient in contrast to internal combustion engine vehicles. On the other hand, the impact of the uncoordinated charging of PEVs is expected to create new challenges for the established distribution grid. This article initially evaluates the impact of uncoordinated charging on the voltage regulation and transformer loading in the city of Heraklion, Greece. Then, a coordinated charging strategy is proposed to deal with the issue of transformer capacity violation by PEVs. Two cases were considered when the transformer overloading from PEV charging was taken into consideration: (a) keeping the transformer below its nominal capacity limit and (b) keeping the transformer below 90% of its nominal capacity limit. This was achieved by distributing the available capacity (nominal capacity minus the residential loads) of the transformer to the PEV chargers in a way that the aforementioned limits were satisfied. Real-world data of the distribution grid and the hourly power consumption of the city were used to validate the proposed method. Results show that possible transformer capacity violation can be tackled by the proposed coordinated charging, without exceeding the voltage regulation limits. © 2022 by the authors.

Thus, the monitoring of transformers and their ancillary equipment, such as bushings, is of great importance to improving the operational efficiency of these assets. In this context, this paper presents the development of a monitoring system for the measurement of partial discharges (PDs), which are a key parameter in the analysis of insulation condition. PD measurements were performed using the electrical method. For this purpose, a capacitive coupling device was developed for bushings that works as a sensor for high-frequency signals and also as a protection apparatus to guarantee the integrity of the bushings in cases of extreme events, such as lightning surges. In addition, a computational routine is presented that applies a digital filtering process followed by a proposed step for differentiating PDs from noises. For validation, the proposed system was subjected to laboratory tests and field applications, from which the viability of the project and the efficiency in detecting PDs were verified. © 2020 by the authors.

Box 1093, Yamoussoukro, Cote d'Ivoire","In the last decades, a large focus is being placed on the sustainability and safety of the power transformer spectrum. Ester liquids, which have interesting properties such as high fire point and biodegradability, are gaining needed attraction. Since in-service condition, thermal aging deteriorates the physicochemical and electrical properties of liquid dielectrics, it is important to study their long-term behavior. In this contribution, the pre-breakdown and breakdown behavior of ester fluids (synthetic and natural) under AC stress are investigated. Important characteristics, such as partial discharge pre-inception voltage, partial discharge inception voltage, breakdown voltage, average streamer velocity, and inception electric field, were assessed. The influence of the radius of curvature (of high voltage needle electrode) as well as the thermal degradation of typical ester liquids are also discussed. Mineral oil was also included in the tests loop as a benchmark for comparative purposes. It is found that the pre-inception voltage of ester liquids was, in most cases, higher than that of mineral oil. For a given radius of curvature, the streamer inception and breakdown voltages decreased with thermal aging. During the streamer initiation, the electric field at the electrode tip decreased with the increase in the radius of curvature. The velocity of the streamers seems to increase with the decrease in the radius of curvature. The period of vulnerability, the so-called “delay time”, seems to be independent of the aging or the radius of curvature for a given condition of the liquid. © 2021 by the authors.

Transformer is one of the most effective parts of the electrification, but electric vehicle charge equipment generate uncertain, fast and short impulses in the demand side of the grid especially in transformers. Consequently, transformers have been shown unusual reactions which can change standard parameters such as temperature, hot-spot point or same parameters. Therefore, they need to change energy convention at the first step. Afterwards, electrification equipment should be designed by both technical and economic conditions. In this paper, transformers temperature reactions under the electric vehicle fast charge load will be analyzed with literatures.

According to the measured output of wind-solar complementary power station, kernel density estimation is adopted to fit the probability density distribution of wind farm output as well as photovoltaic power station output. The joint probability density distribution of wind power and photovoltaic is established using Copula theory, and Kendall rank correlation coefficient is used to measure the degree of correlation between wind power and photovoltaic. For the assessment of outgoing transformer operation risk, the characteristic temperature of transformer is calculated based on Susa model. In addition, this paper proposes evaluation indexes including insulation deterioration probability (IDP), insulation failure probability (IFP), and expected loss of insulation life (ELOIL). Afterwards, the assessment of outgoing transformer operation risk is completed by Monte Carlo method. Finally, the wind-solar complementary power station located in Qinghai province is chosen as case study and it verifies the effectiveness of proposed method.

The source localization based on the times of arrival was previously studied, comparing different strategies for solving the location equations and the most efficient strategy in terms of computational and complexity costs versus performance was selected for analyzing the error propagation. The errors of the acoustic emission source location (localization process) are evaluated from the errors of the times of arrival (detection process). A hybrid programming architecture is proposed to optimize both stages of detection and location. It is formed by a virtual instrumentation system for the acquisition, detection and noise reduction of multiple acoustic channels and an algorithms-oriented programming system for the implementation of the localization techniques (back-propagation and multiple-source separation algorithms could also be implemented in this system). The communication between both systems is performed by a packet transfer protocol that allows continuous operation (e.g., on-line monitoring) and remote operation (e.g., a local monitoring and a remote analysis and diagnosis). For the first time, delay errors are modeled and error propagation is applied with this error source and localization algorithms. The 1% mean delay error propagation gives an accuracy of 9.5 mm (dispersion) and a maximum offset of 4 mm (< 1% in both cases) in the AE source localization process. This increases proportionally for more severe errors (up to 5% reported). In the case of a multi-channel internal fiber-optic detection system, the resulting location error with a delay error of 2% is negligible when selecting the most repeated calculated position. These aim at determining the PD area of activity with a precision of better than 1% (<10 mm in 110 cm). © 2021 by the authors.

The comparison is based on theminimumTOC. This is achieved through a field-validated distribution transformer design program that automatically minimises the objective function (TOC). In particular, 12 oil-immersed distribution transformers are designed: 6 three-phase transformer banks and 6 three-phase transformers; these designs meet all the requirements of a given transformer standard. As a result, curves of minimum TOC versus transformer rating are obtained for threephase transformer banks and three-phase transformers. Moreover, similar curves from seven transformer manufacturers are collected; the advantage of this collection is that these different manufacturers have different types of transformers: oil immersed or dry type, core or shell type, various voltage classes and power ratings, and so on, and consequently more general conclusions can be drawn regarding the comparison of three-phase transformer banks and three-phase transformers. From these investigations, it was found that from the viewpoint of minimum total mass and minimum TOC, three-phase transformer banks should be recommended in case of small-size transformers (rating lower than 45 kVA). This is an important finding that is not emphasised in recommended practices reported in transformer textbooks.

Among all the developed methods for PD monitoring, the electrical PD measurement is the only recommended method by the standard for the acceptance test of transformers due to its calibration possibility of the charge of PDs, specified as the apparent charge. However, the significant dependency of apparent charges to the location of the PDs inside the transformer winding makes the defining a proper threshold value as an accepted PD level a demanding task. In this contribution, the feasibility of a new method to estimate the charge of the PD at its origin in the winding has been studied. The proposed method reconstructs the original current of PD in a limited bandwidth using PD signals measured at terminals of a transformer along with the sectional winding transfer functions and the input impedance of the winding. The original charge of PD will be determined from its reconstructed original currents. This charge value can provide a more robust threshold value for the PD acceptance test as well as a better evaluation of the severity of PD. According to the proposed method results, the estimated charge values are in the range of 0.26–1.88 of the original charge of PD, while the apparent charge values could be 0.02 of the original charge value in the IEC standard method. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Acceptance tests; Electric transformer testing; Partial discharges; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Power transformers; Winding; Apparent charges; Feasibility studies; Induced charges; Input impedance; Insulating system; Limited bandwidth; Partial discharge measurements; Threshold-value; Transformer windings,Apparent Charge; Charge Estimation; Partial Discharge (PD); Power Transformer; Real Charge; Transfer Function,"S.

By comparing electric field distribution under different fiber core radius, jacket thickness and jacket permittivity, the influential factors on such distribution was analyzed. The results show that electric field concentration happens near the inner diameter of the jackets in the insulating filling strips between turns.

While easy to obtain and certainly useful, this data source may lead to erroneous readings as the ambient temperature, such as the proposed in the standard IEEE C57.91-2011, should be based on the air temperature in contact with the radiator of the transformer, which might divert considerably from the atmospheric temperature measured by a weather station on the vicinity. Differences can be attributed to several factors such as the distance to the meteorological stations, architectural constraints, reduced ventilation, and/or exposure to direct sunlight. These variations could affect the outcome and accuracy of algorithms used for aging prediction, maintenance, and planning. This matter is of additional importance in regions with extremely high temperatures, as transformers ratings are based on the assumption of an ambient temperature of 30 °C. To investigate this effect, this paper studied the difference between the recorded atmospheric and substation temperatures under extreme hot climates. Measurements were performed at a standard outdoor transformer station in the middle east for a year, including the summer months' harsh meteorological conditions and the milder winter, to capture significant temperature fluctuations. The data presented can provide insights for more accurate equipment aging modeling and maintenance planning. © 2021 IEEE.",Electric power transmission networks; Smart power grids; Transformer substations; Aging algorithms; Architectural constraints; Maintenance planning; Meteorological agency; Meteorological condition; Meteorological station; Temperature fluctuation; Transformer stations; Atmospheric temperature,RFID wireless sensing; Smart grids; Substation maintenance; Transformer temperature monitoring,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-172818897-3,,,English,"IEEE Power Energy Soc.

However, the use of natural ester is playing an increasing role as safer and eco-friendly alternative to mineral oil. From the utilities’ perspective, the change in the mineral oil paradigm can be approached by replacing their assets by new eco-friendly transformers or refurbishing their assets, substituting only the insulating fluid. To make an informed decision, guidelines indicating how a transformer designed for mineral oil would behave when operating with natural ester, are of paramount importance. In the present research, temperature rise tests were carried out in a 15MVA ODAF core-type power transformer, under different operating conditions. Tests were run for mineral oil as insulating fluid and subsequently repeated for natural ester. To gain further insights on experimental results, thermal modelling of the transformer under the same test conditions was carried out, using Thermal-Hydraulic Network Models and Computational Fluid Dynamics techniques. From the present work it was found that the relationship between the thermal behaviour of the transformer using natural ester or mineral oil is not simple as it depends on the operating conditions of the transformer and on the geometry of the windings. © 2021, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

A special test setup was built, consisting of a tank and heaters, simulating the active part of the transformer, and a radiator bank, with the pump in the pipe connecting the tank and the radiators. Fans were mounted below (vertical blowing) and on the side (horizontal blowing). The main parameters measured include temperatures, oil flow, and pressures in characteristic positions. The motivation behind the experimental research lies in the somewhat higher discrepancy between oil flows through the radiators calculated using detailed thermal-hydraulic model from the results of heat run tests in the case of forced oil flow and the application of the radiators for the outer cooling. Since the calculated oil flows were higher than the values obtained from the heat run test, it was obvious that there are some additional pressure drops along the oil path. The hypothesis is that these pressure drops appear in the top and bottom head of the radiators. Corresponding measurements, analysis, and steps taken to fine tune the detailed thermal-hydraulic model are presented in this paper. © 2019 IEEE.",Drops; Electric batteries; Electric transformer testing; Hydraulic models; Oil filled transformers; Power transformers; Pressure drop; Tanks (containers); Thermal management (electronics); Active parts; Additional pressure drops; Experimental research; Heat-run tests; Main parameters; Oil immersed power transformer; Test setups; Thermal hydraulic modeling; Radiators,Oil immersed power transformers; outer cooling; pressure drop; radiator head; radiators,"Z.R.

Sealing failure poses a great threat to the long-term and reliable operation of the bushing and power transformer; however, the criterion to evaluate the sealing status of a bushing caused by mechanical problems is still lacking. In this paper, a transformer bushing model is established to gain theoretical insight into the relationship between temperature and pressure of a compact multilayer bushing. To evaluate the bushing mechanical status, different sealing conditions are tested based on the temperature and pressure monitoring within the physical 110 kV bushing. The results show that mechanical sealing failure can be diagnosed when the fluctuation of the oil pressure value exceeds the theoretical curve in steady state by 3 kPa. With different reliability coefficients, gas leakage and oil leakage are available to be further determined. The primary and auxiliary criteria based on oil pressure and its gradient are proposed to evaluate comprehensively the actual sealing condition of the bushing, and a wireless oil pressure module is developed at the bottom valve, which is quite beneficial to field online application. It is promising to extend the online mechanical monitoring and diagnosis to oil-immersed power equipment. © 2021 by the authors.

Accurate computation of transformer stray load loss is imperative in localizing the hotspot regions and design of adequate insulation system and consequently cooling system. This loss must also be met by manufacturers based on the customer specifications to avoid penalties. The review of current scientific works affirms the ongoing interest in utilizing the advancement of computational power for painstaking evaluation and management of stray load loss in electric transformers.

As a tool of the dependence mechanism between variables, a copula function can effectively analyze the correlation between variables when it cannot determine whether the linear correlation coefficient can correctly measure the correlation between variable relationships. In this paper, the edge variable of a copula function is selected from the fault characteristic gas of a transformer, and the distribution type of the edge variable is fitted at the same time. Then, Bayesian estimation with the Gaussian residual likelihood function is used to fit the parameters of a copula function and a copula function is selected to describe the optimal dependence of the fault characteristic gas of transformer. The relationship between a copula function and the state of transformer is studied. The results show that the copula function boundary with hydrocarbon gas as edge variable can divide the transformer as healthy or defective state. When the cumulative distribution probability (CDF) value of the dissolved gas in the oil in the copula function is close to 0.8, the fluctuation of its gas concentration leads to a sharp change in the probability. Therefore, the analysis of dissolved gas in oil based on a copula function can be used as a powerful technical solution for oil-immersed power transformer fault diagnosis. © 2022 by the authors.

They are simple, non-destructive and inexpensive. Researchers applied different spectroscopy techniques for condition assessment of insulation paper, mineral and ester oils. Among these techniques, Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) technique showed promising results in correlation with some dielectric, physical, chemical properties and aging by-products. However, this technique is not very sensitive especially with complex mixtures as insulating oils. Thus, photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) was introduced for condition assessment of the insulating oils. PL spectroscopy is more sensitive, simple and can be implemented online using compact and inexpensive sensors. In this paper, several insulating oil samples were aged with different durations and were tested using PL spectrometer to obtain their PL spectra. The impact of aging on the PL spectra is investigated. Moreover, parameters deduced from the PL spectra were correlated to the dielectric dissipation factor and aging by-products deduced from UV-Vis spectroscopy test. Finally, a new criterion based on PL spectroscopy is introduced for condition assessment of insulating oil. The new criterion specifies the acceptable limits for the parameters deduced from the PL spectra.  © 2021 IEEE.",Insulation; Oil filled transformers; Photoluminescence; Power transformers; Spectrometers; Ultraviolet visible spectroscopy; Accelerated ageing; Assessment tool; Condition assessments; Dielectric dissipation factors; Non destructive; Optical spectroscopy techniques; Power transformer insulation; Simple++; Spectra's; Spectroscopy:spectroscopy; Photoluminescence spectroscopy,Accelerated aging; Dielectric dissipation factor; Photoluminescence; Spectrum,,Haque N.; P.

In this paper, the inverse filter (IF) method to localize PDs in power transformers is proposed. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first time that the inverse filter method has been used to localize PD sources in the electromagnetic regime. The method comprises two phases: the forward phase and the backward or backpropagation phase. In the forward phase, the waveform emitted from the PD source is recorded with one or several sensors. In the backward phase, the recorded signal is transformed into the frequency domain, inverted, transformed back into the time domain, and then back injected into the medium. Finally, a suitable criterion is used to localize the PD source. The efficiency of the proposed IF method is assessed considering different scenarios. It is shown that, for the considered configurations, the proposed IF method outperforms the classical time-reversal technique. © 2022 by the authors.

Feeders overload is one of these problems, resulting in inability to supply some loads. In addition, losses are increase, and higher than the world standard value. These problems can be solved by increasing the voltage at the distribution networks. The Yarimja substation (132/33/11 kV) in Mosul was selected to collect feeder data and transformer loads. Transformer loads are redistributed to ensure safe loading of transformers. The rearrangement of the distribution transformer takes into account the optimal solution for irregular distributed power in networks.

Therefore, long-term effects as loading and ageing should be considered in the problem. The most crucial reason in such a long term problem in power system is reliability issues. Accordingly, in this paper, long-term effect of loading on transformer failure rates has been modelled and demand response (DR) has been implemented to reduce loading rate of the system. In order to optimize effectiveness of DR, its implementation cost has been added to the objective function of the problem. In addition, reducing the failure rate of existing transformer may decrease the need for a new transformer so that the reliability of the system has a desirable level. On the other hand, a decrease in existing transformer loading rate in the long run, makes them more valuable at the end of the planning horizon. Hence, the value of transformers should be embedded in the objective function. Additionally, reducing loading rate causes lower loss of load at contingencies caused by transformers from two point of view, first reduced failure rate and second reduced peak load. The developed model has been implemented on transformers of THE IEEE 24-bus reliability test system (IEEE RTS) in two case studies. Results show DR can enhance network performance technically by increasing network reliability and decreasing transformer loading and can improve network operation economically by decreasing operational and expansion costs © 2022",Electric transformer testing; Outages; And transformer replacement planning; Demand response; Failure rate; Loading rate; Long-term effects; Objective functions; Optimization problems; Power systems engineerings; Transformer loadings; Transformer replacement; Failure rate,And transformer replacement planning; Demand response; Failure rate; Reliability,"D.

Therefore, electrical energy must always be available economically and of good quality, such as voltage or frequency and reliability. To maintain the continuity of electric power in distributing electrical energy required protection system is needed. The function of this protection system is to detect and disrupt power network interruptions from other non-interrupted networks as quickly as possible with the intention that greater losses are avoided. The usual disturbances are 3 phase, 2 phase, and 1 phase short circuits. To secure the electrical power system from various disturbances, especially the transformer, the protection relay is very important. The protective relays are used for a transformer covered an overcurrent relay (OCR), ground fault relay (GFR). This paper is a calculation and analysis of the OCR/GFR based on the settings on a 60 MVA transformer at the 150 kV Cibatu Substation in West Java. The results of a comparison between the calculation and the data that is installed in the main substation is quite similar. The calculation results on the time multiplier setting (TMS) show that the OCR setting on side 20 kV plots in 0.20 of TMS while the OCR setting on 150 kV side obtains in 0.23 of TMS. Moreover, the GFR is adjusted on 20 kV side obtained 0.18 of TMS while the GFR setting on 150 kV side is 0.107 for the TMS. In general, these studies show that the settings installed on Cibatu Substation is still in good condition but it needs monitoring to face load demand changes. © 2018 IEEE.",Electric grounding; Electric power system protection; Electric power systems; Frequency multiplying circuits; Relay protection; Surge protection; Transformer substations; Calculation results; Electrical energy; Electrical power system; High voltage substations; Overcurrent relays; Protection systems; Relay settings; Time Multiplier Settings; Transformer protection,protection system; relay Setting; short circuit disturbance; time multiplier setting,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-153865251-0,,,English,"Electr.

In order to solve the problem of low accuracy of traditional machine learning diagnosis methods, a multilevel fault diagnosis model of transformer based on hierarchical classification, generalized learning and ensemble learning is established. According to the imbalanced degree of each category sample, the method established the corresponding classifier, and carried on the diagnosis step by step. At the first level, the broad learning system was selected to extract three generalized feature labels—normal, discharge and overheat, which were fused with the original parameter input to guide the nine more detailed state types. In the second-level classifier, EasyEnsemble learning method is used to generate multiple data-balanced training subsets through under-sampling, fully balancing the fault information of most classes and a few classes, and then synthesized the final classifier through parallel training sub-classifiers, avoiding the problem of missing data information due to under-sampling. Experimental results show that, compared with the traditional diagnosis methods, the proposed method improved the generalization characteristics of a few types of faults, improved the overall accuracy rate, and had a more accurate and balanced fault diagnosis effect of power transformer. © 2022",Balancing; Computer aided diagnosis; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Machine learning; Power transformers; Broad learning system; Diagnosis methods; Ensemble learning; Fault diagnosis model; Fault types; Hierarchical classification; Imbalanced sample; Multilevels; Transformer fault diagnosis; Under-sampling; Classification (of information),Broad learning system; Ensemble learning; Hierarchical classification; Imbalanced samples,"B.

However, the requirement for large numbers of fault samples becomes an obstacle to this demand. This article creatively uses a large number of health data, which is much easier to obtain by power companies, to improve diagnosis accuracy. Comprehensive investigations from the view of both data set and methodology to deal with this problem are presented. A data set consists of 9595 health samples and 993 fault samples is used for analysis. The characteristics of the data set and the influence of the health data on diagnostic accuracy are discussed. The performance of many state-of-art algorithms that handle the imbalanced problem is evaluated. Meanwhile, an efficient fault diagnosis algorithm named self-paced ensemble (SPE) is presented. In SPE, classification hardness is proposed to include the data characteristic in the classification. This method can guarantee the diversity of the data set and keep high performance. According to the experiment results, the superior of SPE is confirmed and also proves that involving more health samples can improve transformer diagnosis when fault data are limited. © 2020 The Authors.

However, due to conflicting multi-criteria and goals and factors, higher standards are required for green distribution transformer manufacturing. High standard manufacturing makes many manufacturers shoddy the internal components of green distribution transformers, resulting in disorderly competition in the market, which poses great challenges to the users' choice of transformers and the government's quality supervision. This paper proposes a cloud-based q-rung orthopair fuzzy multi-criteria framework for assessing the green distribution transformer manufacturing process from the perspective of conflicting relationships between criteria. It is applied to rank order four green transformer manufacturers in China based on the twelve mono-criteria under four categories of resource and energy utilization, production process and equipment, environmental coordination, green technology innovation, and their overall performance ranking results. Our analysis revealed that resource and energy utilization and green technology innovation is the motivating factors to improve the quality of green distribution transformer manufacturing and expert recognition, and the production process and equipment and environmental coordination are the inducing factors that reduce the quality of green distribution transformer manufacturing and the recognition of experts. These findings provide the demanders and government quality inspection departments with guidelines on the selection and evaluation of green distribution transformers, also identify the direction for the manufacturers to improve the technology and optimize the production of green distribution transformers. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Commerce; Electric transformers; Energy conversion; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Environmental technology; Cloud-based; Distribution transformer; Fuzzy multi-criteria framework; Green distribution transformer; High standards; Manufacturing process; Multi-criteria; Multi-Criterion; Q-rung orthopair cloud; Transformer manufacturing; assessment method; fuzzy mathematics; green economy; innovation; instrumentation; manufacturing; multicriteria analysis; pollutant removal; Quality control,Fuzzy multi-criteria framework; Green distribution transformer; Manufacturing process; Q-rung orthopair cloud,"W.-L.

Due to their high power density and relatively good efficiency. These transformers are still used in wind farms and traction, where not only the efficiency, but the overall size and weight of the transformer are important design criteria. However, the determination of the load losses is based on analytical or pseudo-empirical formulations during the design optimization process.

Experimental results indicate that throughout fault development, voltage drops became more frequent until arcing occurs, so is HFCT signal; meanwhile gas generation rate increases through slight partial discharge, spark discharge and arcing stage, the collected gas volume corresponds with patterns above. The purpose of this study is to clarify the defect developing process and the gas generation-convergence pattern for oil-immersed transformer internal fault in guidance for a more reliable protection method. © 2021 IEEE.",Defects; Gas generators; Gases; Oil filled transformers; Power transformers; Transformer protection; Developing process; Fault developing pattern; Gas generation; Gas generation-convergence pattern; Gas protection; Internal faults; Light gas; Light gas protection; Oil immersed transformers; Transformer; Partial discharges,fault developing pattern; gas generation-convergence pattern; light gas protection; transformer,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-166540064-0,,,English,"IEEE China Int.

Concurrently, the connection of DER may provide substantial flexibility to the operation of distribution grids and market players such as aggregators. This paper proposes an optimization framework for the energy management and scheduling of operation for Low Voltage (LV) networks assuring both admissible voltage magnitudes and minimized line congestion and voltage unbalances. The proposed tool allows the utilization and coordination of On-Load Tap Changer (OLTC) distribution transformers, BESS, and flexibilities provided by DER. The methodology is framed with a multi-objective three phase unbalanced multi-period AC Optimal Power Flow (MACOPF) solved as a nonlinear optimization problem. The performance of the resulting control scheme is validated on a LV distribution network through multiple case scenarios with high microgeneration and EV integration. The usefulness of the proposed scheme is additionally demonstrated by deriving the most efficient placement and sizing BESS solution based on yearly synthetic load and generation data-set.

The DSO calculates this optimal charging curve to flatten the load curve of the distribution transformers as much as possible by coordinating the daily recharging of PEVs. The objective is to establish the optimal power profile of the PEV aggregators needed to flatten the power curve supplied by the transformer, so that PEV customers’ needs can be met throughout the day. The proposed framework is applied in a case study accounting for uncertainties associated with charging through Monte Carlo simulation, in order to find the POU tariff. The results demonstrate that applying the POU tariff determines the transformer’s minimum power limit necessary to meet all PEV users’ needs. Additionally, the day-ahead POU tariff does not generate new demand peaks, since it does not concentrate the energy supply of flexible loads in pre-established time bands. Finally, simulation reflects the significant effect of the PEV charging on the distribution system in terms of enhancing the voltage profile, maximizing the transformer life, and reducing the power/energy losses. © 2019 MDPI AG.

To optimally manage the electricity procurement of the building and mitigate the rate of transformer aging, the building energy management system (BEMS) employs the flexibility of batteries and EV charging. In the proposed model, to incentivize EV owners to offer their flexibility, the BEMS organizes a transactive market among plugged-in EVs. To this end, EV owners submit their response curves and the target state-of-charge to the BEMS. Then, the transactive market is cleared to determine the market-clearing price for each EV, the optimal EV charging decisions, and accordingly, the scheduling of office building. Also, to model the correlated uncertainties of solar power generation and demand, the distributionally robust chance-constrained method is employed. Moreover, the “Big-M” technique and the piecewise linear approximation method are utilized to linearize the optimization problem. Finally, the case of a building with 100 charging piles is studied. The numerical results illustrate a decrease in the total operating cost of BEMS and the rate of transformer aging compared to uncontrolled charging and direct control approaches. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Commerce; Electric vehicles; Energy management systems; Office buildings; Piecewise linear techniques; Scheduling; Secondary batteries; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Building energy management systems; Building energy managements; Chance-constrained; Chance-constrained approach; Charging managements; Distributionally robust chance-constrained; Electric vehicle charging; New energies; Transactive market; Transformer ageing; building; electric vehicle; energy management; energy use; optimization; photovoltaic system; Piles,Building energy management; Distributionally robust chance-constrained; Electric vehicle; Transactive market; Transformer aging,"H.

The strategy works under constraints that the vehicle should reach the full State-of-Charge (SOC) at the departure time and the charge power should be constant during all time when the PEV is at home. The application of the DP algorithm on 10,000 real case studies shows that the approach proposed is a Vehicle-to-Home (V2H) concept because it allows cost savings at users. The financial gains obtained by a French PEV user can reach 22.9%. In addition, it is shown that the strategy proposed is also a Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) concept because it allows at the distribution electric grid manager to preserve the grid elements such as the life duration of a low voltage transformer.",,Dynamic programming; Life duration; Low voltage transformer; Plug-in electric vehicle; Residential areas; Vehicle-to-grid; Vehicle-to-home,,,International Journal of Renewable Energy Research,13090127,,,,English,Int.

This will have adverse impact on the power network assets including the distribution transformers which are not primarily designed for excessive loading levels. In this paper, a simple reactive power compensation method to reduce the impact of EV charging on distribution transformers is proposed and analyzed. The method is based on providing a component of residential reactive power demand by operating EV chargers at non-unity power factors thus reducing overall transformer currents. Three scenarios for reactive power compensation are discussed. The feasibility of the proposed method is demonstrated in a 53-node radial distribution system. The transformer overloading regions are divided into different severity zones. With the proposed method, the complete elimination of the most severe zone is achieved in almost all cases along with a significant reduction in other zones. © 2020 IEEE.",Electric power utilization; Electric transformers; Energy conversion; Reactive power; Distribution transformer; Electric transportation; Power networks; Radial distribution systems; Reactive power compensation; Transformer currents; Transformer overloading; Unity power factor; Plug-in electric vehicles,Battery charger; Electric vehicle; Reactive power compensation; Transformer,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-172815826-6,,,English,ECCE - IEEE Energy Convers.

Health Index approach is commonly used to aggregate those parameters into single value. With more complete parameter, more accurate Health Index can be obtained, however, the cost will also be higher.

This type of equipment is subject to various types of faults that can affect its components, in some cases also compromising its operation and, consequently, the electric power supply. Thus, in this paper, electromagnetic, thermal, and structural analysis of power transformers was carried out with the objective of providing the operator with information on the ideal moment for performing predictive maintenance, avoiding unplanned shutdowns. For this, computational simulations were performed using the finite element method (FEM) and, from that, the different transformer operation ways, nominal currents, inrush current, and short-circuit current were analyzed. In this perspective, analyses of the effects that thermal expansion, axial forces, and radial forces exerted were carried out, contributing to possible defects in this type of equipment. As a study object, simulations were carried out on a 50 MVA single-phase transformer. It is important to emphasize that the simulations were validated with real data of measurements and with results presented in the current literature. © 2021 by the authors.

The reliability of power transformer operation is directly related to its condition. Detection of winding deformations is possible by means of sweep frequency response analysis. Interpretation of SFRA results is usually performed by visualization of images generated using specialized devices and comparison of transfer functions obtained from successive tests. This diagnostic method is known as a fingerprint and its disadvantage is the subjectivity and relying on engineer's experience. This paper presents an experimental approach for detection of internal transformer short-circuit faults. Existing mathematical indicators based on frequency response analysis are often unable to unambiguously indicate the degree of fault and their determination requires high-cost measurement and signal processing equipment. A new indicator based on the reverberation time, commonly employed in acoustics, is proposed instead. The proposed parameter is based on time-domain calculation and enables reliable detection of transformer inter-turn short circuits and accurate estimation of their degree. A significant advantage of the proposed approach is its low dependence on the frequency range of the measured signal, which allows employment of low-cost measuring and signal processing devices. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Architectural acoustics; Cost benefit analysis; Electric power systems; Fault detection; Frequency response; Reverberation; Signal processing; Time domain analysis; Transformer windings; Winding; Condition; Diagnostic methods; Experimental approaches; Faults detection; Reverberation time; Short-circuit fault; Signal-processing; Sweep frequency response analysis; Winding defects; Winding deformations; Power transformers,Fault detection; Power transformer; Reverberation time; Signal processing; Winding defects,"B.

Despite the standard measurement procedure of the frequency response, the interpretation of the results still lacks an objective methodology. Therefore, the interpretation of FRA results is still a subject of study. The interpretation means to detect the existence of a fault, its type, and its extent. As a step forward in this path, this paper suggests a new method to discriminate between different fault types in the FRA method, i.e., the method can detect the fault type. Here, a connection triangle is proposed where the FRA variations corresponding to three different connections are mapped onto a ternary plot. The outcome is that different fault types are accumulated in various areas of the ternary plot, which leads to the fault type classification. In addition to different simulation results, the outcomes of experiments are used in this paper to prove the functionality of the idea. © 2022 IEEE.",Computer aided diagnosis; Electric fault currents; Electric transformer testing; Frequency response; Power transformers; Classification algorithm; Electrical faults; Fault types; Faults detection; Faults diagnosis; Frequency response analysis; Mechanical and electrical; Mechanical faults; Power transformer testing; Standard measurements; Fault detection,classification algorithms; fault detection; fault diagnosis; frequency response; power transformers testing,"M.H.

In this study, some simple sensors, which are made from a few turns wrapped around the transformer core, are used to detect PD signals. Moreover, a feasibility study is done to identify defective phase/region based on the captured PD signals waveforms through these sensors. The idea is implemented on a 50 kVA, 20 kV/400 V three-phase transformer by injecting artificial and quasi-real PD signals to different sections of HV windings. Also, various transformer connections are considered in the experimental studies to find the effect of them on the waveforms of the captured signals (e.g. peak-to-peak value and signal energy). The obtained experimental results show that small PDs (as low as 10 pC) is detectable by the mentioned sensors and defective phase can be identified in all of transformer connection cases. Furthermore, considering failure to identify defective regions by broadband analysis, a limited-band approach is proposed through obtaining |H(s)| for the sensors.

Differential protection relays with the second harmonic restraint criterion are traditionally used for the transformer protection. This conventional criterion may fail to perform properly in some cases which results in the incorrect relay operation. A novel high-frequency-based algorithm is proposed in this paper to discriminate between the magnetizing inrush currents and the internal faults. Teager energy operator (TEO) is used here to extract high-frequency information from the differential current signals. Differential currents resulted from an internal fault have more high-frequency transients than those resulted from a magnetizing inrush and this is the basic principle used in the proposed algorithm. A very simple and effective operator is proposed in this paper to quantify the overall high-frequency transients of a signal. The proposed algorithm uses a quarter of a cycle of the differential currents along with the very simple mathematical operators to do its task. Therefore, this is a very fast and simple algorithm. The algorithm is tested by the simulated and experimental test signals. Results show the robustness and reliability of the proposed algorithm. © 2022",Electric fault currents; Electric power system protection; Power transformers; Transformer protection; Differential current; Differential protection; Fluctuation identifier; High frequency transients; Internal faults; Power; Protection methods; Protection relay; Simple++; Teager energy operators; Mathematical operators,Differential protection; Fluctuation identifier; High-frequency transient; Teager energy operator,"S.

Transportation survey data is used to estimate travel miles and arrival/departure times for a typical residential neighborhood, which is subsequently used to estimate the electric load curve with different levels of PEV penetration. The estimated load curves are used to perform transient heat transfer computations for a system of three buried cables using an overset grid finite-difference approach, the results of which are used to estimate acceleration of cable thermal degradation.

The controller regulates the charging power according to the state of charge (SoC) of EV and the voltage at the point of connection of EV charger. The objective of the controller is to charge EVs while keeping the voltage of different distribution system points within the acceptable limits. Most of the proposed methods for controlled charging of EVs depend on the availability of the communication infrastructure which enables communication between utility operator and EV chargers which is not available in the current distribution networks and requires a huge investment. So, an autonomous controller which does not need communication infrastructure is developed in this study. The controller is designed to charge EVs without violating the voltage limits which can occur in case of uncontrolled charging of EVs. The effectiveness of the controller is tested on a residential low voltage (LV) distribution network and the simulations are executed with MATLAB/SIMULINK. The network performance in case of controlled charging of EVs is compared with the uncontrolled charging of EVs and the base case when no EVs are connected.

This has generated unprecedented challenges and opportunities for utility companies-opportunities especially in the area of asset health/performance management. Moreover, several utilities are increasingly moving from the traditional reactive and time-based asset monitoring approach to a more proactive condition based method. However, this needs to be done in a low-cost and efficient manner.

The safe and stable operation of transformer is of great importance for the reliable transmission of electricity generated from renewable energy and for the reliable use of electricity by the end users. Therefore, it is important to assess the condition to avoid the faults of the transformer. In this paper, a variable weight synthesizing assessment model is presented that combines the G1 method, the entropy weight method, and a variable-weight method proposed in this paper to assess the condition of transformer based on the offset of the transformer equivalent circuit parameters. First, we propose deterioration indexes oriented to the maintenance management needs, which can well reflect the degree of deterioration of each transformer component. Second, the various defects of the transformer are used as the assessment indexes, and the initial weight is given to the assessment indexes according to the damage degree of the defect. The initial weight is calculated comprehensively by the G1 method and the entropy weight method. Then, each index is scored according to the offset of the equivalent circuit parameters, and the weights are adjusted appropriately according to the scores of the indicators using a variable weighting method to emphasize the severity of the defect or the “sub-health” condition of the transformer. Finally, the respective scores and combined weights of the assessment indexes are weighted to obtain a comprehensive score. The simulation shows that the model is more sensitive to abnormal and “subhealth” conditions of the transformer, which verifies the feasibility of the variable weight synthesizing model to assess the condtion of the transformer.

First, seven sets of vegetable oil-paper insulation samples with different moisture content and different degrees of aging were prepared, the frequency domain spectroscopy (FDS) technology was adopted to measure the frequency domain dielectric spectrum and convert it into a dielectric modulus spectrum. Then, the fractional model was adopted to identify the parameters, the characteristic quantities closely related to the water content ωC and the degree of polymerization DP were selected, and the functional relationship was established. Finally, an field vegetable oil transformer was used to measure and to preliminarily verify the effectiveness of the method. The experimental results show that the fractional model can effectively simulate the changing trend of the dielectric modulus spectrum, and the proposed characteristic parameters are closely related to moisture and aging. In the evaluation of moisture content, the characteristic parameters α, β, Ma and ωC are power-related, and the characteristic parameter τ is exponentially related to ωC. In the evaluation of aging degree, the characteristic parameters α, Ma, τ are power-related with DP, and the characteristic parameter β is exponentially related with DP. © 2022, High Voltage Engineering Editorial Department of CEPRI.

This paper defines extreme conditions as the state of a load or network that breaks the limits of the constraints in an optimization model. Once these constraints are violated, the optimization algorithm might not work correctly and might not converge to a feasible solution, especially when the complexity of the system increases and includes nonlinearities. Hence, the algorithm may not help in mitigating the impact of penetrating PEVs under extreme conditions. To solve this problem, an original algorithm is suggested that is able to adapt the constraints’ limits according to the energy demand and the energy needed to charge the PEVs. Different case scenarios are studied for validation purposes, such as charging PEVs under different state of charge levels, different energy demands at home, and different pricing mechanisms. Results show that our original algorithm improved the profiles of the voltage and power under extreme conditions. Hence, the algorithm is able to improve the integration of a high number of PEVs on the distribution system under extreme conditions while preserving its stability. © 2021 by the authors.

The proposed strategy provides a simple and effective fixed-point iteration-based formulation for a balanced secondary distribution network, that is extended for an unbalanced three-phase underground secondary distribution network. The efficacy and a detailed statistical analysis of the proposed scheme are studied on a balanced and an unbalanced secondary distribution systems against 1,000 random load profiles through Monte-Carlo simulations which represent uncertainty in smart meter data, with theoretical analysis on convergence and stability also provided.

The proposed strategy provides a simple and effective fixed-point iteration-based formulation for a balanced secondary distribution network. The efficacy and a detailed statistical analysis of the proposed scheme are studied on a balanced secondary distribution system against 1, 000 random load profiles through Monte-Carlo simulations which represent uncertainty in smart meter data. The results indicate that the proposed scheme provides better results in comparison to fixed power assumptions for a distribution transformer kVA load estimation, and the results from this work may contribute to further smart-grid applications. © 2021 IEEE.",Electric power transmission networks; Electric transformers; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Smart power grids; Uncertainty analysis; Distribution transformer; Electricity consumers; Load estimation; Load information; Novel strategies; Power factors; Power load; Residential electricity; Secondary distribution systems; Simple++; Smart meters,Distribution transformer; secondary distribution system; smart meter,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-166542928-3,,,English,"IEEE Electr.

The need for emission reduction and the potential of EVs for these reductions is reflected in the current sustainable mobility policies of the EU as well as the German government. Increasing the penetration of EVs in the grid requires an expansion of EV charging infrastructure, which in turn requires either grid reinforcement or solutions for more efficient use of existing infrastructure to avoid or postpone grid reinforcement. Distribution transformers face increased loading due to EV charging and need to be protected from overloading during peak load periods to ensure continuity of service. Therefore, transformers are one of the components that are upgraded or replaced as a part of grid reinforcement. In this paper, we propose the connection of a Solid-State Transformers (SST) between two buses operating at the same-voltage level as an alternative to replacement or upgrading of conventional transformer as well as to prevent their overloading. We analyse how the proposed topology can be useful to reduce the impact of EV integration on the overloading of distribution transformers and node voltage violations in the distribution grid. © 2022 by the authors.

Also, the energy bound calculation (EBC) model is proposed to find the upper and lower bounds of flexible sources. Also, taking into account the EBC results and the power order from the aggregator, a charge power allocation algorithm is designed to distribute the power of flexible electric vehicles (EVs).

Due to environmental impacts, depletion of fossil fuel reserves and used oil discard problems encouraged the researchers to work towards alternative insulating oil for traditional mineral oil. In this work, vegetable oils like olive oil and coconut oil are mixed with mineral oil at various compositions. The key parameters such as dielectric strength, acid content, viscosity, flash point, and fire point are measured as per the standards. The experimental results show that natural ester performs better than mineral oil, and with the increase in mixing ratio, the performance of mixed liquid insulation also increased. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Dielectric liquids; Dielectric properties of liquids; Environmental impact; Fossil fuels; Insulation; Mineral oils; Oil filled transformers; Olive oil; Proven reserves; Coconut oil; Dielectric strengths; Dielectrics property; Keys parameters; Liquid dielectrics; Mixed liquid dielectric; Performances analysis; Power system components; Transformer insulation oil; Used oil; Minerals,Dielectric properties; Mineral oil; Mixed liquid dielectric; Vegetable oil,"A.

Load balancing is carried out by monitoring the values of the angles of the active and reactive components of the vector unbalanced power. Likewise, the application of Order 3/2020 of the Spanish National Markets and Competition Commission is described, in detail, for the calculation of the economic costs derived from the transformer energy losses caused by the load currents and the penalties due to transformer energy deliveries with capacitive power factors. Finally, all these improvement techniques are applied to determine savings in carbon dioxide emissions and costs on the electricity bill of an actual 1000 kVA distribution transformer that supplies a commercial and night-entertainment area. The results of this application case reveal that cost reductions due to energy loss savings are modest, but the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions and the savings in penalties for capacitive reactive supplies are significant. © 2021 by the authors.",Carbon dioxide; Cost reduction; Energy dissipation; Energy efficiency; Industrial emissions; Losses; Oil filled transformers; Capacitive penalization; Carbon dioxide emissions; Distribution transformer; Environmental assessment; Improvement technique; Oil-filled; Oil-filled distribution transformer; Penalisation; Transformer efficiency; Transformer loss; Global warming,Capacitive penalizations; Environmental assessment; Oil-filled distribution transformer; Transformer efficiency; Transformer losses,"V.

The charging of a high number of EVs harms the distribution system. As a result, increased transformer overloads, power losses, and voltage fluctuations may occur. Thus, management of EVs is required to address these challenges. An EV charging management system based on machine learning (ML) is utilized to route EVs to charging stations to minimize the load variance, power losses, voltage fluctuations, and charging cost whilst considering conventional charging, fast charging, and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technologies. A number of ML algorithms are contrasted in terms of their performances in optimization since ML has the ability to create accurate future decisions based on historical data, which are Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The results verify the reliability of the use of LSTM for the management of EVs to ensure high accuracy. The LSTM model successfully minimizes power losses and voltage fluctuations and achieves peak shaving by flattening the load curve. Furthermore, the charging cost is minimized. Additionally, the efficiency of the management system proved to be robust against the uncertainty of the load data that is used as an input to the ML system. © 2021 by the authors.

CO and CO2 are one of the main fault characteristic gases dissolved in transformer oil. Thus, monitoring the CO and CO2 dissolved in transformer oil is considered by the power industry as an important means to ensure the safe operation of power systems. This work proposes the measurement of the CO and CO2 dissolved in transformer oil using Raman spectroscopy and generalized regression neural network (GRNN). Firstly, 200 samples were divided into training sets and test sets. After that, Raman spectroscopy as the input of GRNN, and The concentration of CO and CO2 dissolved in transformer oil as the output of GRNN. Afterwards, the experimental method was incorporated to get the best smoothing factor σ for GRNN. Then, the GRNN with the best smoothing factor σ=24 was trained with the training sets, and the model was verified with the test sets. The experimental results show that the prediction accuracy of the prediction model of the CO and CO2 dissolved in transformer oil based on GRNN is 90%.

These transformers significantly affect the reliability of the power grid. One of the most critical components of a transformer is insulating oil. Insulating oil is responsible for heat transfer and electrical insulation. Scheduled monitoring of transformer oil ageing can improve the status of the transformers and make significant changes to increase the reliability of the power grid. The main reasons for oil ageing are thermal and electrical pressures. These tensions cause chemical degradation of the oil. Therefore, by several types of tests, the relative ageing of the oil can be detected. Current industrial methods are generally offline and costly. In this paper, a laboratory-based method for online transformer oil analysis based on spectroscopy technique has been proposed and implemented. Furthermore, machine learning algorithms implemented on system results to distinguish between oils with different ageing. According to the obtained results, the presented method is effective with high accuracy. © 2020 IEEE.",E-learning; Electric power system protection; Electric power transmission networks; Heat transfer; Insulation; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Power transformers; Transformer protection; Chemical degradation; Critical component; High-accuracy; Industrial methods; Interconnected power grid; Oil analysis; Online transformers; Power grids; Oil filled transformers,Machine learning algorithms; Oil ageing; Power transformers; Spectroscopy,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-073812631-9,,,English,"Int.

This parameter is one of the most critical, which is closely monitored. During the operation of transformer oil in the power equipment of electric power systems, about 10 grams of water per ton of oil is allowed, i.e. the permissible proportion of water is 10 ppm (ppm). The aim of the work is to develop a new method for determining the permissible proportion of water in transformer oil in small quantities. This goal is achieved by performing spectral studies of transformer oil samples in the UV and visible range with the addition of cobalt (II) chloride (CoCl2) powder. Сobalt (II) chloride has the ability to change its color depending on the amount of water of crystallization. The most significant result of the article is the conclusion, obtained on the basis of the recorded spectra, about the relationship between the optical density of the spectrum in the range of 360-490 nm and the moisture content of transformer oil when adding cobalt chloride powder. The significance of the results obtained is that the authors have proposed a new optical method for determining small values of the proportion of water in transformer oils, based on the dependence of the optical properties of cobalt (II) chloride on moisture content.This method has a very high sensitivity, low cost for determining the proportion of water and is very promising for solving problems of power energy. © Kozlov V.K., Turanova O.A., Kurakina O.E., Turanov A.N.",,Absorption spectra; Cobalt (II) chloride; Crystalline hydrate; Insulating oil; Water,,,Institute of Power Engineering,18570070,,,,English,Probl.

An increase in the content of the aromatic hydrocarbons leads to the appearance of a precipitate, and as well as due to its hygroscopicity, an increase in the moisture content. The latter is one of the transformer oil parameters that determines its quality. In power equipment, the presence of moisture of the order of 10 grams of water per ton of oil is allowed. At elevated water concentrations, there is a risk of the power transformers’ failure. The aim of the work was to develop new methods for determining the aromatic compounds and water contents in the transformer oil in small quantities. This goal was achieved by conducting spectral studies of the transformer oil samples in the UV range and constructing correlation lines to determine the moisture content and concentration of aromatic compounds.

The significance of the obtained results lies in the fact that the optical method for determining the moisture content and aromatic hydrocarbons in transformer oils, using the constructed correlation lines, is highly accurate and does not require the use of additional reagents and complex calculations. © 2022 Saint-Petersburg State University.

This analysis was evaluated for the contiguous U.S, using five general circulation models (GCMs) under two greenhouse gas emission scenarios, to analyze changes in damage and cost from the baseline period to the end of the century with three different adaptation strategies. Total infrastructure costs were found to rise considerably, with annual climate change expenditures increasing by as much as 25%. The results demonstrate that climate impacts will likely be substantial, though this analysis only captures a portion of the total potential impacts. A proactive adaptation strategy resulted in the expected costs of climate change being reduced by as much as 50% by 2090, compared to a scenario without adaptation. Impacts vary across the contiguous U.S. with the highest impacts in parts of the Southeast and Northwest.

A convenient way of analysing time-domain dielectric response φ(t) is the formulation of simple resistance −capacitance-based circuits like the conventional Debye model (CDM) or the modified Debye model (MDM) that are capable of modelling φ(t). However, available techniques do not guarantee unique branch parameters of such circuits for a given φ(t). In fact, the branch parameters are known to depend on the curve-fitting procedure opted during model formulation. This makes accuracy of CDM and MDM parameter-based diagnosis techniques less reliable. Furthermore, it seems logical to analyse the time-domain dielectric response of oil-paper insulation using a model containing time-varying parameters. In this study, a methodology is proposed using which such an insulation model (containing time-varying parameters) is formulated using time-domain insulation response. Related analysis presented suggests that the proposed model is immune to problems associated with available insulation models (containing time-invariant parameters). The performance of the proposed model in indicating insulation condition is tested on data obtained from several real-life power transformers. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2019.",Curve fitting; Insulation; Oil filled transformers; Paper; Phonons; Power transformers; Time varying control systems; Diagnosis techniques; Dielectric response function; Insulation conditions; Insulation diagnosis; Insulation response; Modified debye models; Oil paper insulation; Time varying parameter; Time domain analysis,,"C.M.

This paper contributes to the knowledge regarding the operational process of future power networks by developing a realistic and stochastic charging model of electric vehicles (EVs). Large-scale integration of EVs into residential distribution networks (RDNs) is an evolving issue of paramount significance for utility operators. Unbalanced voltages prevent effective and reliable operation of RDNs. Diversified EV loads require a stochastic approach to predict EVs charging demand, consequently, a probabilistic model is developed to account several realistic aspects comprising charging time, battery capacity, driving mileage, state-of-charge, traveling frequency, charging power, and time-of-use mechanism under peak and off-peak charging strategies. An attempt is made to examine risks associated with RDNs by applying a stochastic model of EVs charging pattern. The output of EV stochastic model obtained from Monte-Carlo simulations is utilized to evaluate the power quality parameters of RDNs. The equipment capability of RDNs must be evaluated to determine the potential overloads. Performance specifications of RDNs including voltage unbalance factor, voltage behavior, domestic transformer limits and feeder losses are assessed in context to EV charging scenarios with various charging power levels at different penetration levels. Moreover, the impact assessment of EVs on RDNs is found to majorly rely on the type and location of a power network. © 2019, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,electric vehicles (EVs); residential distribution networks (RDNs); state-of charge (SOC); time-of-use (TOU); voltage unbalance factor (VUF),"S.

Traveling by electric vehicles (EVs) instead of conventional fuel cars is strongly supported by national governments for the sustainable development of urban transportation. However, the increasing EV charging load in residential areas have brought a heavy burden to the distribution transformer. Therefore, coordinated charging of EVs in the residential charging station (RCS) is essential to relieve the power supply pressure. In this paper, an optimal charging strategy based on dynamic spike pricing (DSP) policy is proposed to reduce the charging cost of EVs and ensure the normal operation of the distribution transformer. First of all, the load model of EVs on four kinds of typical days is established with consideration of the seasonal and holiday characteristics of EV charging demands. Then, a new DSP policy based on Time-of-Use (TOU) mechanism is designed with an additional spike time period and a spike price to transfer peak loads in rush hours. To protect EV users from financial losses and prevent transformer overload, an optimal charging model is formulated to minimize the charging cost of EVs with considering the power margin of the distribution transformer. Ultimately, the genetic algorithm (GA) is used to solve the model. The simulation results show that the optimal charging strategy proposed in this paper is effective in peak shaving and reducing charging cost. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Charging (batteries); Cost reduction; Electric automobiles; Electric power systems; Electric transformers; Genetic algorithms; Housing; Losses; Sustainable development; Transformer protection; Urban transportation; Coordinated charging; Distribution transformer; Electric Vehicles (EVs); National governments; Normal operations; Residential areas; Residential charging; Transformer overloads; Environmental protection,Dynamic spike pricing (DSP) policy; Electric vehicles (EVs); Optimal charging; Power margin; Residential charging station (RCS),"J.

This fact creates an environment suitable for the management and operation of different components connected to the electrical system, such as distribution transformers. Literature shows that the power losses in these transformers represent a considerable amount of the total losses in distribution systems. In the last decades, several methodologies have been proposed for the estimation and management of these losses. In this context, this paper discusses the power loss behavior in distribution transformers connected to conventional and special components, such as conventional loads, distributed generators and electric buses, highlighting how vital is the monitoring for the proper management of these assets.

The phenomena analyzed in this paper are largely caused by the inrush current that occurs at the energization of the transformer, which led to the generation of electric arc and also to the appearance of gases dissolved in the transformer oil. The analysis of dissolved gases in oil (DGA) sampled from a 440-MVA in-service transformer was performed, using the Duval Pentagons 1 and 2, which provide additional information that can help identify various types of failures, especially if their nature is different. The results obtained from the DGA analysis led to the identification of thermal faults caused by electric discharges both inside the transformer, and outside it. The technical inspection carried out after the DGA analysis led to the validation of the analysis; there were traces of these electric discharges.

However, due to technological constraints linked to voltage and currents, the PV hosting capacity has been substantially constrained. Therefore, this paper proposes a competent approach to maximize PV hosting capacity in a low voltage distribution network based on voltage control and dynamic line rating of the cables. Coordinated voltage control is applied with an on-load tap changing transformer, and reactive power compensation and active power curtailment of PV inverters. A case study with probabilistic and deterministic assessments is carried out on a real Sri Lankan network to show how the PV hosting capacity is constrained. The findings revealed the capability of integrated voltage control schemes and dynamic line rating in maximizing hosting capacity. The study is expanded by incorporating the PV rephasing approach in conjunction with the aforementioned control techniques, and the effectiveness of PV-rephasing is clearly demonstrated. When compared to voltage control and conductor static rating, the combined rephasing, voltage control, and DLR yielded a 60% increase in PV hosting capacity. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the use of power transformers in the context of smart grids creates new challenges for efficient lifetime management and maintenance planning. The use of intermittent sources of energy and dynamic loads increases the sources of uncertainty and causes non-linear operation dynamics. In addition, the increased use of probabilistic forecasting models for the estimation of influential parameters such as temperature or load, influences the uncertainty associated with the transformer lifetime estimation. These variable operation mechanisms influence the operation and lifetime planning of power transformers. Accordingly, this paper presents a novel probabilistic health state estimation framework to improve the lifetime management of power transformers operated in smart grids through the integration of probabilistic forecasting models with Monte Carlo based Bayesian filtering methods. © 2019 RedINtrnasf.",Condition monitoring; Dynamic loads; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Monte Carlo methods; Plasma diagnostics; Power transformers; Lifetime estimation; Maintenance planning; Operation mechanism; Probabilistic forecasting; prognostics; Sources of uncertainty; transformer; Transformer condition monitoring; Smart power grids,Condition monitoring; diagnostics; probabilistic forecasting; prognostics; transformer,,Lopez-Fernandez X.M.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-840911743-7,,,English,ARWtr - Proc.: Adv.

Real-time estimation of transmission line parameters, utilizing voltage and power flow measurements provided by remote terminal units (RTUs) located at two substations across the line, has been investigated, recently. This paper improves this approach by introducing a novel exact linear reformulation of the problem, which can be solved in closed form. The distributed-parameter model of long transmission lines is considered and its parameters are estimated in a non-iterative manner using RTU measurements. The method is also extended to estimate transformer series impedance and tap position by SCADA measurements, linearly. As such, the disadvantages associated with the previous iterative approach, e.g. concern over convergence, for transmission line parameters are avoided. Moreover, the novel technique for estimating transformer parameters allows to determine the tap position as well as updated transformer series impedance. Furthermore, a thorough analysis is presented to take the measurement accuracy into account.

In order to clarify the relationship between the operation mode of EVs, peak charging load and peak power load of grid, this paper defines two key parameters: coincidence factor and mutual coincidence factor. The variation tendencies of these two parameters under different EVs scale and charging rate are also analyzed. Based on the characteristics of EV charging load and the power load of distribution network in residential area, an evaluation method for distribution network supportability is proposed. Finally effectiveness of the evaluation method are verified by distribution network in residential area. The results show that by choosing the capacity of transformer properly, the ability of the distribution network for the integration of EV can be greatly improved. © 2016 IEEE.",Charging (batteries); Electric power distribution; Electric vehicles; Housing; Vehicles; Charging loads; Charging rate; Coincidence factors; Electric vehicle charging; Operation mode; Residential areas; Supportability; Variation tendencies; Electric load distribution,Charging load; distribution network; electric vehicle; supportability,,,IEEE Computer Society,21574839,978-150905418-3,,,English,"Asia-Pacific Pow.

This paper proposes to use Baobab oil (Adansolia digitata) as insulator. The Baobab oil is modified using the additives such as hydrocarbon -C12H26-C15H32 (AD1) and aluminium-II-oxide (AD2) of size 10 nm. The modified natural ester (NE) called nano natural ester (NNE) shows good dielectric strength at 7.5 mL/L of AD1 and 0.75 g/L of AD2. NNE is prepared by blending AD1 and AD2 using ultrasonic waves. Here, in NNE, AD1 serves as thinner, and AD2 acts as electron scavenger. The NNE is then subjected to accelerated heasting at 100 °C for 720 h. The dielectric properties like AC breakdown voltage, fire point, kinematic viscosity (at 30 °C), acid number and water content are measured at 120 h. The data is then used as an input to Euler’s method (EM) for predicting the ageing rate for 1440 h. The prediction results of EM are confirmed using the artificial neural network (ANN); ANN shows significantly less deviance. The prediction results of NNE, NE and conventional insulating fluid (CIF) like mineral oil are compared, which indicates that NNE ages at a slower rate than CIF. Under lower temperature loading, NNE ages slower than the predicted results and shows endurance beyond 2880 h. Hence, the use of NNE is a cost-effective and suitable solution to insulating fluids in power and distribution transformers. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Additives; Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Blending; Cost effectiveness; Dielectric properties; Esters; Insulation; Neural networks; Aging rates; Baobab oil; Cooling media; Dielectric fluid; Dielectric strengths; Electron scavengers; Euler’s method; Insulating fluid; Natural esters; S-method; Forecasting,Ageing rate; ANN; Baobab oil; Dielectric fluid; Euler’s method; Prediction,"R.

The streamer characteristics were assessed mainly on the basis of registration of light emitted during streamer development and additionally on the basis of propagation velocity evaluated. Three liquids were tested during the studies namely mineral oil, synthetic ester and natural ester. A non-uniform electric field was created by point-to-sphere electrode system, a standard practice in laboratory, although very much unlikely taken place in real transformers. Two liquid gaps 20 mm and 40 mm were considered. The studies included LIBV determination of free liquid gaps, acceleration voltage determination in each case and streamer behavior assessment when 4 mm in thick pressboard barrier was placed 10 mm below HV tip. The results showed the differences in LIBV of the liquids considered in favor of natural ester for 20 mm gap and in favor of mineral oil for 40 mm gap. However when comparing acceleration voltage much better properties indicated mineral oil tested, what was expected based on literature data. When introducing the pressboard barrier the streamers significantly changed their characteristics in relation to the system without barrier. In most cases, at the values of the voltage at which the streamers developed as fast, they have been slowed down. Additionally, the differences in breakdown voltage when barrier introducing were significantly reduced. This fact is a benefit in assessment of ester liquids at lightning impulse stresses and in consideration for their use in power transformers. © 2021 IEEE.",Electric fields; Esters; Mineral oils; Minerals; Power transformers; Acceleration voltages; Insulating system; Lightning impulse stress; Nonuniform electric field; Positive streamers; Propagation velocities; Sphere electrodes; Standard practices; Liquids,ester liquids; lightning impulse voltage; streamers,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-166541840-9,,,English,ICEMPE - Int.

It has become the bottleneck restricting the engineering and industrialization development of transformer industry. Based on experimental big data, this paper uses the expert diagnosis method of fuzzy mathematics to establish a superior evaluation model. The typical design process of distribution transformers is scored by experts, and the short-circuit passing rate is calculated according to the real short-circuit test data. Linear regression analysis is used to establish the regression equation, and a pre-diagnosis technique for short-circuit withstand capability of distribution transformers is proposed. At the same time, the validity of the model is verified by the actual case, and the accurate pre-diagnosis of the resistance to short-circuit capability is realized.

This paper proposes a novel fault diagnosis method called the expertise-guided machine learning (EGML) model where a genetic algorithm (GA) and a mind evolutionary algorithm (MEA) are used as optimization algorithms. Thereby, two types of EGML models are generated, that is, the GA-EGML model and the MEA-EGML model. In the EGML model, knowledge function replaces the cost function of traditional artificial intelligence algorithms, which can provide additional information for each individual and bring some corrections to the prediction results. To investigate the application potentials of the proposed models in power transformer fault diagnosis, real dissolved gases data are utilized to evaluate the diagnosis performance of the proposed models. Results indicate that the performance of the EGML model outperforms the traditional back propagation neural network (BPNN) model and all other models participating in the comparison. Both the GA-EGML model and MEA-EGML model can be used to diagnose the faults of a power transformer, and the latter is better. In addition, to further investigate the robustness of the proposed models for different data, four scenarios are simulated. Empirical results show that the accuracies of all models decrease in the other three scenarios compared to the baseline scenario, especially in scenario 2. However, the proposed models decline less than the traditional models in scenario 2 and scenario 4, and obtain satisfactory accuracy in all scenarios. © 2019 by the authors.",accuracy assessment; artificial intelligence; back propagation; climate prediction; detection method; electronic equipment; genetic algorithm; machine learning; numerical model; prediction; simulation,Expertise-Guided Machine Learning model; Fault diagnosis; Genetic algorithm; Mind evolutionary algorithm; Power transformer; Robustness test,"H.

In such areas, low voltage lines are used for long distances, which cause power losses and voltage drop for different types of consumers. Reducing losses and improving voltage profiles in rural distribution networks are significant challenges for electricity distribution companies. However different solutions were proposed in the literature to overcome these challenges, most of them face difficulties when applied in the conventional distribution network. To address the above issues, an applicable solution is proposed in this paper by installing a number of small-capacity distribution transformers instead of every single large-capacity transformer in rural areas. The proposed approach is implemented in the branch network of Al-Hoqool village, which belongs to the Nineveh distribution network. The network has been inspected on-site, drawn, and analyzed using the electrical systems analysis program (ETAP). The analysis showed that using the single-phase pole-mounted transformers can improve the voltage in the network’s end by 29% and enhance the voltage profile for all consumers. The analysis has also demonstrated that the modification can reduce the total power losses by 78% compared to the existing network. Concerning the economic aspect, the payback period for the proposed network is assigned to be 20 months. © 2022, Tech Science Press.

To reduce failures and extend the service life of power transformers in operation, the issue of enhancing the techniques for assessing the condition of their internal insulation becomes relevant. Currently, when selecting the major insulation of transformers, one takes into account the dependency of the dielectric strength of the oil passage on its width. Experts discuss the issues involved in the choice of major insulation while taking into account the effect of the generalized factor being the volume of the oil passage. The solution to that problem largely depends on the study of the statistical characteristics of the dielectric strength of oil passages of different volumes and the effect rated parameters of transformers have on them. The efficiency of the application of such diagnostic characteristics depends on the extent of studies available on them and the establishment of their standardized parameters. The paper proposes a method for estimating the change in the transformer oil volume in stressed oil passages of major insulation of high-voltage power transformers and statistical characteristics of the dielectric strength of these passages while taking into account the effect of the rated values of capacity and voltage of transformers. It is shown that the degree of effect of transformer technical parameters on the statistical characteristics of the dielectric strength of oil passages depends on the quality of transformer oil, which undergoes a change in operating conditions. © 2022 by the authors.

Power transformers are High Voltage (HV) transformers which are used to step up power in power stations. These transformers suffer due to many issues of failures. One of the reasons for failure of these transformers are considered to be partial discharge (PD). Partial discharge happen due to number of reasons and discharge due to availability of tiny conductors is considered in this paper. These tiny conductors are considered to flow from bottom of the transformer to top of the transformer. When such conductor comes in contact with transformer winding, electrical stress is formed. When this stress surpasses the breakdown strength of the insulating medium partial discharge occurs. Breakdown strength of the insulating medium is a factor which changes due to practical issues at the field.

Split winding structures are adopted for impedance requirements in high-speed railway AT, which are connected inside transformer. Frequency response analysis (FRA) curve of each split winding cannot be directly measured, thus it is difficult for the existing FRA model and diagnostic method to distinguish the faults. In this paper, the method of FRA interpretation based on multi-decomposition and image features is proposed to obtain more information on the frequency response curves, which helps to analyze the small changes. Verification and analysis are carried out by conducting series capacitance variation (SCV) experiments on different windings and different positions in the split winding AT. The results show that the multi-level decomposition FRA curve has a strong correlation with original FRA curve. After being converted into a polar coordinate graph, the graph is different under different fault conditions. The features correlation degree (FCD) values of different fault windings are obviously different, and different faults have their corresponding laws. According to the 12 image features extracted from polar graph and corresponding features correlation after seven-level decomposition, the SCV at different fault windings, fault locations and fault degrees in autotransformer can be distinguished. © 2021, High Voltage Engineering Editorial Department of CEPRI.

The hot-spot temperature is a primary factor affecting the reliability and service life of power transformers. In order to calculate the temperature distribution of oil-immersed transformer windings accurately, it is required to solve a multi-physical problem, in which the magnetic field and the fluid-temperature field are coupled. In the simulation of multi-physical field of transformer, many studies usually omit the turn-to-turn insulation of windings to simplify the oil-immersed transformer model. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of the turn-to-turn insulation of windings in oil-immersed transformers on the simulation results. First, a 2D axisymmetric transformer model was established in ANSYS to study the effect of low-voltage winding turn-to-turn insulation on the magnetic field simulation results. The differences of eddy current losses in the simulation were also calculated in terms of the magnetic field simulation results. It is found that the turn-to-turn insulation does not affect the magnetic field distribution in evidence from the simulation results. Besides, the values of the magnetic field and eddy current loss appear significant differences only at both ends of the low-voltage winding. Second, the fluid-temperature field of the transformer was solved in Fluent and the turn-to-turn insulation was the controlled objective in the solution process with consideration of the difference in winding losses. The simulation results show that the turn-to-turn insulation of the winding does not change the oil flow distribution in simulation. The simulation model with turn-to-turn insulation appears a gradient in the temperature distribution of the discs and a rise in the overall temperature distribution. Moreover, this paper analyzes the possible reasons for the differences in the simulation results of the magnetic and temperature fields caused by the turn-to-turn insulation. Some results and conclusions in this paper can be used in related studies and designs. © 2020 IEEE.",Eddy current testing; Electric power system economics; Electric power transmission; Electric power transmission networks; Energy conversion; Insulation; Losses; Magnetic fields; Oil filled transformers; Power transformers; Temperature distribution; Winding; Controlled objective; Low voltage windings; Magnetic field distribution; Magnetic field simulation; Multi-physical fields; Oil immersed transformers; Transformer modeling; Turn-to-turn insulations; Transformer windings,ANSYS; Fluent; fluid-temperature field; magnetic field; turn-to-turn insulation,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-172815511-1,,,English,"IEEE Int.

Temperature is one of the best-recognized indicators of health. Infrared Thermal Imaging is a standardized heat signature modeling tool. As of contemporary setting, thermal imaging has become a mature and highly regarded method of condition monitoring, in which temperature measurements can be conducted in real-time in a non-contact manner. Infrared thermography is used as a means to distinguish variations from the normal temperature range, within the transformer. Slight temperature fluctuations are appropriate, but any unusual change must be recognized, which may be a sign of possible failure and must be handled promptly. Unusually high temperatures will damage the insulation of the transformer and thereby reduce its life span. This paper outlines an approach to diagnosis, calculation of per-unit life, and impact of aging due to abnormal temperature on transformer winding which would help power utility companies for better monitoring of their valued asset. © 2020 IEEE.",Condition monitoring; Temperature measurement; Transformer windings; Accelerating factors; Heat signatures; High temperature; Hotspot temperature; Infrared thermal imaging; Power utility; Temperature fluctuation; Temperature range; Thermography (imaging),Aging Acceleration Factor; Hotspot Temperature; Infrared thermal imaging (IRT); Per Unit Life; Transformer Preventive maintenance,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-172815070-3,,,English,"IEEE Int.

However, the evaluation parameters required in the existing evolution prediction methods are not only difficult to obtain, but also result in large deviations in the estimated time due to the improper fusion between the parameters. Therefore, in this paper, based on the improved full-state integration method model, the multi-spectral image fusion of the power equipment and the prediction of the evolution of fault gradual changes effected by multi-parameters are studied. The temperature parameters of key components of the devices are extracted from the unstructured image data by matching the infrared detection image with the infrared standard library and by the infrared-visible light image fusion. A clustering algorithm combined with the operating parameters is used to diagnose faults. And then, a load / environment-temperature rise model is constructed by integrating the short-term electrical loads and the environmental factors. And the follow-up trend of the equipment faults are estimated through correlating those state constraints such as thermal aging, the load rate, and the light. The PT fault evolution experiment of the voltage transformer based on the comprehensive state evaluation shows that the method in this paper can effectively identify the equipment and locate and classify the thermal defects. It can predict the changes of the equipment's operating state with the load and the environment. And it provides a theoretical basis for the intelligent decision-making of maintenance without any outage of the power equipment. © 2021, Power System Technology Press.

This way, in addition to sending the warning signal in the case of gas concentration, a fault diagnosis procedure can be conducted using standard Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) methods. However, since the fault diagnosis outcome and result of these methods are sometimes different, an appropriate solution should be suggested to accurately describe the transformer internal condition. To do so, a robust multi-layer framework has been proposed in this paper. Handling the measurement uncertainties and fusing the results of independent DGA methods without losing their diagnosis resolutions are the interesting features of this framework. To improve the overall accuracy of fused diagnosis result, an artificial neural network-based approach is proposed. It intelligently assigns the weight of each independent method in the fusion procedure according to its fault type detection accuracy for the range of input gasses concentrations. To evaluate performance of the proposed framework, comprehensive test studies have been conducted and the promising obtained results prove its superior performance for use in online applications. © 1986-2012 IEEE.",Electronic assessment; Failure analysis; Neural networks; Oil filled transformers; Power transformers; Uncertainty analysis; Diagnosis procedure; Dissolved gas analyses (DGA); Fault type detection; Measurement uncertainty; On-line applications; On-line conditions; Online continuous monitoring; Overall accuracies; Fault detection,Dissolved gas analysis (DGA); Information fusion; Power transformer online monitoring,"M.

The TPT are one of the most high-priced equipment in modern power networks, and therefore their working condition should be constantly monitored to prevent their breakdown, power outages and huge financial damage. Accordingly, this paper presents a hybrid method for detection and classification of incipient faults in TPT using dissolved gas analysis techniques (DGAT) information and rule-based machine learning method. In the developed method, the most informative and important items of DGAT data out of 14 items selected by association rules mining technique (ARMT) are employed as the input of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The ARMT is implemented to select the items, which have maximum information and can train the ANFIS more accurately. Furthermore, in order to enhance the accuracy of ANFIS and improve its robustness in different implementations, black widow optimization algorithm is applied for ANFIS training. In order to evaluate the performance of developed method on real issues, two industrial data collections obtained from Iran-Transfo Company chemical laboratory and Damavand power substations are used. The obtained results through MATLAB simulations proved that the developed method has high fault detection and classification accuracy, robust function in different implementations, short run time and simple structure. © 2020, Brazilian Society for Automatics--SBA.",Classification (of information); Electric network analysis; Electric power transmission networks; Fault detection; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Machine learning; MATLAB; Outages; Power transformers; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Association rules mining; Dissolved-gas-analysis techniques; Fault detection and classification; Machine learning methods; Optimization algorithms; Three phase power transformers; Three-phase transformers; Fuzzy inference,BWO; Fuzzy rules; Item selection; Learning algorithm; Transformer,"A.

On-load capacity regulating distribution transformers have been used to deal with loads with great valley/peak differences, so reasonably replacing conventional distribution transformers with on-load capacity regulating distribution transformers can effectively cope with load changes after electric energy replacement and reduce the no-load losses of distribution transformers. Before planning for on-load capacity regulating distribution transformers, the nodal effective load considering uncertainties within the life cycle after electric energy replacement was obtained by a Monte Carlo method. Then, according to the loss relation between on-load capacity regulating distribution transformers and conventional distribution transformers, three characteristic indexes of annual continuous apparent power curve and replacement criteria for on-load capacity regulating distribution transformers were put forward in this paper, and a set of distribution transformer replaceable points was obtained. Next, based on cost benefit analysis, a planning model of on-load capacity regulating distribution transformers which consists of investment profitability index within the life cycle, investment cost recouping index and capacity regulating cost index was put forward. The branch and bound method was used to solve the planning model within replaceable point set to obtain upgrading and reconstruction scheme of distribution transformers under a certain investment. Finally, planning analysis of on-load capacity regulating distribution transformers was carried out for electric energy replacement points in one urban distribution network under three scenes: certain load, uncertain load and nodal effective load considering uncertainties. Results showed that the planning method of on-load capacity regulating distribution transformers proposed in this paper was very feasible and is of great guiding significance to distribution transformer planning after electric energy replacement and the popularization of on-load capacity regulating distribution transformers. © 2018 by the authors.",Branch and bound method; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Electric load loss; Electric losses; Electric power distribution; Electric transformers; Geographical distribution; Investments; Life cycle; Monte Carlo methods; Oils and fats; Planning; Uncertainty analysis; Distribution transformer; Electric energies; Guiding significances; Nodal effective loads; Optimal planning; Optimal planning method; Profitability index; Urban distribution networks; Electric load distribution,Electric energy replacement; On-load capacity regulating distribution transformer; Optimal planning; Urban distribution network,"Q.

Development of nanofluids based on ester oil is considered as the future of insulating fluids which hold great potential to enhance the design aspect of high voltage apparatus. In the current study effect of SiO2 on dielectric properties of natural ester oil has been studied. Based on various electrical analysis, an attempt has been made to identify the optimum concentration of nanoparticles in terms of volume concentration. In order to enhance dispersion and improve surface properties, CTAB has been chosen as a surfactant and its optimum concentration with respect to nanofluid has been established. Corona Inception Voltage (CIV) results indicate that beyond a certain value, addition of nanoparticles can degrade the dielectric properties of oil. These results are further confirmed by testing the Levitation Voltage of the particle in the electrode gap. It is realized that incipient discharges due to corona/particle movement can radiate electro-magnetic waves with its frequency lying in Ultra High Frequency (UHF) signal range. It is observed that the bandwidth of the radiated signal lies in the frequency range of 0.7-2 GHz, with its dominant frequency at 0.9 GHz. It was observed that the number of discharges caused due to corona/particle movement are less for the identified optimum concentration of nano SiO2 in transformer oil. It has been observed that the number of discharges is higher for AC voltage than DC voltage, due to particle movement. © 2018 IEEE.",Biodegradability; Condition monitoring; Dielectric properties; Esters; HVDC power transmission; Low-k dielectric; Nanofluidics; Nanoparticles; Partial discharges; Silica; Surface active agents; Thermal insulation; Corona inception voltage; Discharge characteristics; Electrical analysis; High voltage apparatus; Nanofluids; Optimum concentration; Ultra High Frequency (UHF); Volume concentration; Oil filled transformers,CIV; CTAB surfactant; Ester Oil; LV; partial discharges; SiO2 nanofluids,,"Abu-Siada A.; Curtin University, Electrical Engineering, Computing and Mathematical Sciences, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-153864126-2,,,English,"Cond.

Nevertheless, they have to operate under the partly or fully non-linear excitation because of the increasing amount of the non-linear loads such as rectifiers, electric motor drivers, compact fluorescent lamps, computers, etc. Non-linear loads cause abnormal temperature rise both in the core and in the windings of the transformer which are designed for sinusoidal excitation. Nowadays in the virtual environment provided by the electromagnetic design software, transformers can be easily modeled with the finite element method for any type of non-linear loads or excitations. In this study, 3-D electromagnetic and thermal modeling of the isolation transformer at a certain rated power level have been carried out. Then, the core and the winding temperatures of the transformer have been comparatively reported under the linear and non-linear load conditions. Besides, forced air-cooling method of the transformer has been tested with the CFD. This study has shown that, transformer temperature can be kept in the safe operating region in any type of load by deciding the fan speed providing the required air-flow according to the transformer temperature. © 2020 Society of Thermal Engineers of Serbia.",,Finite element analysis; Fluid dynamics; Total harmonic distortion; Transformer thermal analysis,"S.

The operating temperature of a transformer dominantly governs its aging rate. In the present research, a renewable coolant as a versatile substitution for the petroleum-based oils was investigated to be employed in the cooling of transformers. The studied coolant is a vegetable-based oil extracted from the waste cooking oils. A numerical model was developed to follow the instantaneous changes in the load profile and ambient temperature and predict the instantaneous hotspot temperature values in the transformer under dynamic load. Then, this thermal model was used to explore the capability of the studied vegetable oil in the cooling of transformers compared with conventional transformer oil. The realistic ambient temperature and loading profile, as well as thermal properties of oils and characteristics of a transformer, were applied as the model's inputs. The aging rate of the transformer in the presence of vegetable oil was also compared with the conventional transformer oil. The results indicate a better cooling performance for the vegetablebased oil, where a hotspot temperature reduction of 3 °C was observed in comparison to the petroleum-based oil. Also, the model predicts a significantly longer life for the insulating system of the transformer when the proposed vegetable-based oil is employed. The results of this research suggest a sustainable way of reusing the waste of a renewable resource as an alternative insulating liquid for the cooling of high heat flux electric/electronic devices.

In the past, maintenance personnel spent a lot of time checking the distribution transformers one by one. Nowadays, with the widespread deployment of electrical energy data collection systems for power users, useful measurement data can be provided and used for further condition monitoring. Therefore, this paper proposes a data-driven abnormal state monitoring data collection algorithm for distribution network transformers, which can send abnormal state alarms to operators and maintenance staff in a timely manner. In the proposed algorithm, the Spearman rank correlation coefficient is used to display the correlation between the phase currents, and its t-statistic is used to determine whether there is an abnormality in the data collection based on the hypothesis test. Finally, the actual collected data of Zhejiang Power Grid is used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, and the characteristics of normal and abnormal situations are analyzed separately.

In order to improve the existing regular preventive maintenance mode and implement a 'high-efficiency with low-cost' maintenance strategy, this article proposes an optimal nonperiodic inspection decision-making method for TPSE of URT considering the influence of impact load. First, the comprehensive degradation model of TPSE is established based on the linear Wiener process and the compound Poisson process. Second, the nonperiodic inspection model of TPSE in a single-maintenance period is established by introducing inspection planning functions for three types of degradation processes. With the lowest operating cost per unit time as the decision goal, the optimal maintenance plan is, thus, achieved. Finally, the proposed decision-making method is applied to the benchmark data taken from a URT administration in China related to a dry-type traction transformer in five years. The results show that the proposed method can help formulate efficient inspection strategies with the optimal cost. In addition, sensitivity analysis reflects the influence of different parameters on the optimization results, which helps to identify which parameter exerts the largest influence. © 2015 IEEE.",Construction equipment; Decision making; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric traction; Inspection; Light rail transit; Maintenance; Sensitivity analysis; Compound Poisson process; Decision-making method; Inspection and maintenance; Inspection planning; Maintenance strategies; Preventive maintenance modes; Traction power supply; Traction transformer; Costs,Inspection planning function; nonperiodic inspection strategy; traction impact load; traction power supply equipment (TPSE); urban rail transit (URT),"S.

This methodology seeks to identify and to prioritize the replacement and maintenance of a power asset fleet optimizing the return of investment. It fulfills this objective by considering the risk index, the replacement and maintenance costs, and the company revenue. The risk index is estimated and predicted for each asset using both its condition records and by evaluating the consequence of its failure. The condition is quantified as the probability of failure of the asset, and the consequence is determined by the impact of the asset failure on the whole system. Failure probability is estimated using the health index as scoring of asset condition. The consequence is evaluated considering a failure impact on the objectives of reliability (energy not supplied-ENS), environment, legality, and finance using Monte Carlo simulations for an assumed period of planning. Finally, the methodology was implemented in an open-source library called PywerAPM for assessing optimal decisions, where the proposed mathematical optimization problem is solved. As a benchmark, the power transformer fleet of the New England IEEE 39 Bus System was used. Condition records were provided by a local utility to compute the health index of each transformer. Subsequently, a Monte Carlo contingency simulation was performed to estimate the energy not supplied for a period of analysis of 10 yearsAs a result, the fleet is ranked according to risk index, and the optimal replacement and maintenance are estimated for the entire fleet. © 2021 by the authors.

In fact, voltage and current distortion occur from non-linear load. Trends in the use of electronic component-based equipment for energy efficiency contribute to the loss of the transformer. Non linear load which is fed by the transformer will continuously increase the temperature to be an indication of reducing the quality of the transformer insulation oil. This results in a loss in the performance of the transformer. Non-linear loads can generate harmonic currents caused by rectifier inputs that tend to draw currents in the form of non-sinusoidal and non-continuous. The paper will discuss the effect of harmonics on the deterioration in the quality of transformer insulation materials. Insulating oil is an important part of the transformer given its function as a cooler and insulation, so the quality of the insulation material must be maintained so that the breakdown voltage is always at the permitted limit. Calculation of transformer loss due to harmonics which causes isolation failure will be carried out. The calculation results will be discussed later efforts to reduce transformer losses due to harmonics are expected to be the solution used to reduce the failure rate of transformer isolation. © 2020 IEEE.",Degradation; Deterioration; Energy efficiency; Failure analysis; Green manufacturing; Harmonic analysis; Industrial internet of things (IIoT); Insulating materials; Insulation; Outages; Calculation results; Current distortion; Electronic component; Insulation materials; Sinusoidal currents; Transformer insulation; Transformer insulation oil; Voltage waveforms; Oil filled transformers,breakdown stress; degradation; harmonic; water content,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-172813083-5,,,English,Proceeding - ICoSTA : Int.

The results show that with the increase of the harmonic frequency, the harmonic loss of the transformer winding increases exponentially. When the frequency increases from 50Hz to 650Hz, the harmonic loss increases from 1177.66W to 179289.68W.

They are exposed to harmonic distortion causes negative effects on their operation. Traditionally, harmonic mitigation filters were installed by large power users on the customer side of the power system and the utilities had no control over their operation. Utilities should invest in harmonic mitigation filters to grant them full controllability on the harmonic content coming from either side (utility/customer). This paper presents a proposed design of harmonic mitigation filters installed by the power utilities for power transformers. DIgSILENT software is used for the modelling, analysis, and implementation of the proposed filter design and the verification case studies. A comparative study shows the significant reduction of the total harmonic distortion (THD) for power transformers using the designed filters. With this THD reduction, the negative impacts are reduced and the designed life expectancy of the transformers would be increased. © 2020 IEEE.",Harmonic distortion; Power transformers; Verification; Case-studies; Comparative studies; Filter designs; Harmonic contents; Harmonic mitigation; Life expectancies; Power utility; Total harmonic distortion (THD); Harmonic analysis,harmonic analysis; harmonic distortion; harmonic filters; power transformers,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-172816746-6,,,English,"IEEE PES/IAS PowerAfrica, PowerAfrica",Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85095114040

The lamps represent about 20% of the total load all over the world. The sever distortion produced by LED lamps to network voltage and current waveforms became high challenge to researchers and manufacturers to reduce its effects on the electric equipment. In this paper, the severe side effects of using commercial LED lamps on transformers are investigated, analyzed and its circuit is modified to improve the exploitation of transformer capabilities. A new converter circuit for the LED lamps has been designed to minimize harmonics and improve the voltage quality, power factor (PF) and transformer capability utilization. Also, it guarantees a proper operation even the LED input voltage decreased to 40% of its rated value. To assure the effectiveness of the proposed circuit, a prototype is created and tested considering two scenarios: commercial and proposed LED lamp circuits. Comprehensive comparisons between the effects of the two scenarios on the distribution transformers are conducted. The proposed study is applied to Mansoura University campus microgrid electric network in Egypt. The microgrid is simulated via MATLAB Simulink and applied to the two scenarios. The total harmonic distortion (THD), PF, voltage notching, harmonic loss factor, K-factor, factor-K, and the related derating capacities of the network transformers are calculated and compared using the American and European standards for the prototype and simulator. The results ensure that the proposed circuit could effectively minimize the THD and improve the PF, voltage quality, and the utilization of transformer capacities. © 2022 The Author(s)",Electric network analysis; Electric network parameters; Electric transformers; Energy utilization; Harmonic analysis; Terminals (electric); Timing circuits; Commercial light-emitting diode lamp; Distribution transformer; Factor-K; Harmonic loss factor; K factor; Lightemitting diode; Microgrid; Power factors; Total harmonic distortions; Voltage quality; Light emitting diodes,Commercial LED lamps; Distribution transformer; Factor-K; Harmonic loss factor; K-factor; Power quality,"T.F.

Such approaches should be used as input to investment and planning decisions by distribution-system operators. Distribution networks from two areas in Sweden supplying 309 MV/LV distribution transformers with 12,000 customers downstream have been used to illustrate the different approaches. By defining a break-even length, it is shown that both overload and overvoltage may limit the hosting capacity. The results obtained for the 309 networks show that the overload limit is more often exceeded for transformers than for feeder cables for smaller solar PV sizes. For larger solar PV sizes, feeder cables are likely to be overloaded before the transformers. A stochastic hosting capacity is calculated for 170 of the 309 distribution transformers and compared with a deterministic definition of the hosting capacity. It is shown that the deterministic definition corresponds to a 50% risk of overloading. Both deterministic and stochastic definitions show that transformer overloading is very unlikely as long as the probability of customers installing solar PV is less than 20%. © 2022",Cables; Electric transformers; Feeding; Investments; Solar cells; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Stochastic systems; Deterministics; Distribution transformer; Feeder cables; Hosting capacity; Likelihood; Loadability; Photovoltaic systems; Power distributions; Probability: distributions; Solar photovoltaics; Probability distributions,Likelihood; Loadability; Photovoltaic system; Power distribution; Power system measurements; Probability distribution,"E.

In this study, the inductive OSI test technology and diagnostic methods are investigated. The front time and the oscillation frequency of the OSI are altered by changing the additional inductance, whereas the tail time is affected by both the front and tail resistance. The OSI voltage withstand test is carried out on a 110 kV three-phase double-winding transformer on site. Furthermore, transfer function (TF) analysis is used for the diagnosis of transformer insulation with high sensitivity during the OSI test. The fault winding is distinguished by comparing the change in the voltage TF and current TF at different voltage levels. The partial discharge (PD) detection method has the highest sensitivity, which realizes the early diagnosis of insulation faults. The insulation status of the windings is ascertained based on the number and amplitude of PDs. The test results prove that the inductive OSI voltage withstand test is easy to perform on site and can successfully diagnose the insulation faults of the transformer in more detail compared with other routine insulation tests. © 2022 The Authors.

There are few practical methodologies for evaluating spare transformers. In addition, such proposals do not necessarily take into account the costs that represent the system, either by under-sizing or over-sizing the reserve. According to the above, it is necessary to establish a methodology to balance the cost that would represent to make investments for the acquisition of the reserve transformers, and the benefits that would provide the reliability of the system against such purchases.

One of the components used in the transformer is the insulating oil, responsible for its insulation and cooling. With increasing environmental concern, searching alternatives for the isolation system of transformers arise, since insulating mineral oil comes from petroleum; therefore, it is toxic, harmful to the environment and has low biodegradability. Current research has shown that insulating vegetable oil represents an alternative to be considered by electrical companies, for being a biodegradable fluid with high flash and combustion temperature points, being characterized as a safer solution. This paper aims to analyse the economic advantages and disadvantages of using vegetable- and mineral-oil-filled power transformers in the Brazilian energy distribution system, considering initial investment, useful life, environmental and operational safety issues.

The electrical insulating properties of it deteriorate, and sediments accumulate on the active part, which makes it difficult to remove heat. Inhomogeneous solid formations can induce not only the voltage breakdown, but also impair the parameters such as viscosity and other characteristics of the oil, which are important for the reliable operation of the power transformers. Aromatic groups initially is present in the transformer oil composition during the operation of the oil, and because of the aging processes, the concentration of the unsaturated cyclic compounds increases. The aim of this work is to develop a new method for the determination of the aromatic compounds and colloidal particles. This goal is achieved using a visual inspection of the transformer oil samples in the visible range. The most significant result of the paper is the establishment of a correlation between the acid number of the transformer oil (KOH), the tangent of the dielectric loss angle and the type of oil image under the visible light illumination. The significance of the obtained results lies in the fact that the presented method based on the analysis of the scattered and transmitted radiation, makes it possible to determine the presence of the aromatic compounds and colloidal particles in the transformer oil, as well as to define their concentration and size. This method simplifies the analysis of the transformer oil quality, and reduces the cost of the research, which is an important factor for the electric power industry. © Kozlov V.K., Valiullina D.M., Kurakina O.E., 2021.",,Aromatic compounds; Colloidal particles; Insulating oil; Visual method,,,Institute of Power Engineering,18570070,,,,Russian,Probl.

This paper, presents a novel analytical approach to calculate the transfer function of the cascade model of parallel RLC cells equivalent to power transformer. However, in order to convert the impedance frequency response measurements data to a polynomial ratio, the numerator and denominator coefficients of the transfer function were determined according to the parameters identification of each cell of the RLC model from the FRA data tests obtained in a wide frequency range on each transformer phase. In addition, the developed transfer function in 's domain' has been generalized for an infinite number of cells of the adopted model. However, the transfer function of the RLC model cells has been proposed to meet the requirements of electromagnetic behavior analysis of transformer coils, and to provide a transformer internal faults diagnostic tool. The results of the proposed approach have been confronted to those obtained with experiment, it show a good concordance. © 2019 IEEE.",Cells; Cytology; Electric fault currents; Electric transformer testing; Electromagnetic fields; Frequency response; Power transformers; Denominator coefficients; Driving point impedances; Electromagnetic behavior; Electromagnetic properties; Frequency response measurement; Parameters identification; Polynomial transfer functions; Wide frequency range; Transfer functions,Cascade model of parallel RLC cells; frequency response analysis; power transformer; transfer function,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-172811560-3,,,English,"Int.

On the other hand, uncontrolled charging of these vehicles can cause serious problems in the grid, such as a peak in demand, a decrease in the life expectancy of transformers and as a result, an increase in charging costs of EVs for the EV owners. In this paper, a framework for day-ahead optimal charging of EVs is proposed which through optimization of active and reactive power exchange at each time interval, could prevent the problems mentioned above and at the same time increase the benefit of EV owners and network operators simultaneously. Furthermore, taking into account the effective factors on electrical energy consumption of EVs and the driving pattern of their owners, a route mapping algorithm is developed based on the proposed framework, so as to provide the EV owners with better services. The simulations are carried out using a hybrid interior-point optimization approach, based on traffic and geographic data collected from the city of Kowloon and a standard IEEE 33 bus system is used. The simulation results show that integrating optimal charging of EVs with a route mapping algorithm into the proposed framework can reduce the loss costs of the network during the hours of EVs’ presence in the framework and the selling price of electricity to EV owners by 24.93% and 33.6%, respectively in comparison with the uncontrolled mode. Also, the average life expectancy of power transformers is increased by 2.97% in the optimal charging mode compared to the uncontrolled mode. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Conformal mapping; Electric losses; Electric vehicles; Energy utilization; Power transformers; Case-studies; Cloud storing and computing; Day-ahead; Day-ahead scheduling; Flexible loads; Mapping algorithms; Optimal charging; Power industry; Route mapping; Transformer loss of lives; Scheduling,Cloud storing and computing; Day-ahead scheduling; Electric vehicles; Optimal charging; Route mapping; Transformers loss of life,"M.

Using non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), the objective function finds loading factors of power transformers which guarantee optimum values for both aspects. The proposed method is first performed on a transmission grid including 15 substations without considering failure probability of power transformers. Proving that the proposed method can optimise both technical and economic functions efficiently according to the results, the modified economic model which utilizes failure probability based on degree of polymerization is employed in the second step. It is shown that the economic evaluation considering failure probability and life expectancy of transformers leads to accurate and reliable values.

However, mineral oil is produced from limited petroleum products and is not biodegradable. These reasons motivated researchers to investigate the usage of alternative insulating liquids such as natural and synthetic esters. But, for practical application of ester oils, there is a need to study the influence of the thermal aging on the paper insulation impregnated with such oils, which is the main aim in this paper. The aging of kraft paper in natural, synthetic esters and mineral oil was compared. The oil-paper insulation was aged at 120°C for 72 hrs, 144 hrs and 240 hrs. The dielectric behavior was investigated via using frequency domain spectroscopy analysis over a frequency range from 10HZ to 1 MHZ. The dielectric relaxation times were calculated for unaged and aged oil impregnated paper samples. The results indicated the better behavior of synthetic ester over natural ester and mineral oil. © 2021 IEEE.",Esters; Frequency domain analysis; Mineral oils; Minerals; Oil filled transformers; Power transformers; Relaxation time; Thermal insulation; Ester oil; Insulating fluid; Insulating liquids; Insulation paper; Natural esters; Oil/paper insulation; Synthetic ester and mineral oil; Synthetic esters; Transformer insulation; Thermal aging,Dielectric spectroscopy; Natural ester; Oil-paper insulation; Relaxation time; Synthetic ester,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-166541998-7,,,English,"Int.

Sometimes, due to specific reasons, the limited laboratory infrastructure does not allow a correct match between theoretical concepts that apply to large equipment and experimental devices existing in the laboratory that are typically small power ones. Such a situation may happen for example when studying the electric transformer. During the practical laboratory activities the students may notice a discrepancy between the theoretical concepts and the obtained experimental results because the small power transformers available in the laboratory have operation characteristics whose shapes are different with respect to those of the large power transformers. Thus, this paper proposes a design procedure for didactic purpose small power transformers, that allow the identification of solutions with predominant reactive component of the short-circuit voltage. An example of using this procedure is applied for a dry type small power single phase transformer, with a rated power of 1kVA. © 2020 IEEE.",Design; Electromagnetic fields; Engineering education; Finite element method; Laboratories; Open circuit voltage; Professional aspects; Students; Design procedure; Electrical engineering education; Electrical engineering studies; Engineering study programs; Finite element analyse; Large equipments; Power; Power transformer design; Response surfaces methods; Transformer design; Power transformers,Electrical Engineering Education; Electromagnetic Field; Finite Element Analysis; Power Transformer Design; Response Surface Method,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-172819038-9,,,English,"Int.

The impact of EV charging is important for the Distribution Network Operators (DNO) in order to maintain the normal operation of the grid and to ensure satisfied power usage. In this study, stochastic parameters such as the charging location and the corresponding EV load demand were analysed and used in a base case scenario without Distributed Generation (DG) on the UK Generic Distribution Network (UKGDN).

FRA’s measuring practices have been industrialised and are codified in IEEE and IEC standards. However, because there is no valid coding in the standard, the interpretation of FRA data is still far from being a widely acknowledged and authoritative approach. This study proposes an innovative fault segmentation and localisation technique based on FRA data. The algorithm is based on regression analysis to estimate the repeatability and relationship between the FRA fingerprint and the latest measured data. Initially, the measuring frequency is discretised into three regions to narrow the location of the fault; the regression model of the fingerprint and current FRA data are then evaluated. As a benchmark, two statistical indicators are the employed benchmark against the proposed method. Finally, the proposed scheme identifies and characterises various transformer conditions, such as healthy windings, axial and radial winding deformations, core deformation and electrical faults. The database used in this study consists of FRA measurements from 70 mineral-oil-immersed power transformers of different designs, ratings and manufacturers that were physically inspected for various faults and comparable frequency regions. The results achieved corroborate the efficacy of the proposed regression analysis fault recognition algorithm (RAFRA) model for transformer fault diagnosis using FRA. Further recommendations are made to address the reproducibility concerns induced by multiple FRA testing conditions. © 2022 by the authors.

Taking the winding current, winding hot spot temperature and oil temperature into consideration, a new approach based on the fusion analysis of electrothermal characteristics is proposed to detect the interturn faults in the winding of an oil-immersed transformer. The main idea of the proposed method is to establish the digital space model of the physical transformer with the digital twin technology. Then, multi-physics simulation is used to derive the changing law of the electrothermal characteristics of the transformers under different operation conditions and interturn fault types in the digital space. With the main electrothermal characteristics parameters including winding current and hot spot temperature as the features, a twin fault sample based data-driven model is presented for the interturn fault detection. A case study is carried out on the 31.5MVA/110kV power transformer. The results show that the proposed detection method based on the fusion analysis of the electrothermal characteristic can effectively identify the early latent interturn fault of the power transformer.

In a few years, mass deployment of EVs will put severe stress on the electricity network. Charging of EV during peak hours may overload the distribution grid transformer, and EV owners may have to pay more money for electricity during peak hours. To address these issues, a coordinated scheduling model is proposed in this paper. A mathematical model is formulated to minimise the charging cost of each EV while satisfying the constraints. In this work, time of use (ToU) tariff from the utility and actual power demand from household and EVs are used to conduct simulation for one week in summer and winter season with different levels of EV penetration. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheduling model can significantly reduce the charging cost for the EV owner and power peaks in the distribution network. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Scheduling; Controlled charging; Cost minimisation; Economic benefits; Grid integration; Optimal scheduling; Peak shifting; Charging (batteries),controlled charging; cost minimisation; economic benefits; electric vehicle; grid-integration; optimal scheduling; peak shifting; unidirectional charging,"V.N.

To enhance the applicability of STSM, single regulation and joint regulation methods for the charging price strategy of charging stations are put up, and the mathematical model of joint regulation is focused on. First of all, a joint regulation mechanism is established, in which EVs are guided to charge off-peak and off-station through the joint regulation. Secondly, integrating charging fees, queuing costs, and transfer costs, the equivalent charging prices for EV users are put forward. Based on the difference of the equivalent charging prices, transfer probability model for EVs’ charging periods and charging stations is proposed. Furthermore, the overall objective of joint regulation is built based on the net income of all parties. And an optimization method for the joint regulation of charging prices is proposed. Then, regulation lifting ratio is put forward to reflect the superiority of joint regulation over single regulation. Based on this, an evaluation model for joint station diameter threshold is established. The practical result proves that through single regulation and joint regulation, approximately 200–500 additional EVs can be powered, which will result in significant savings in infrastructure construction and investment costs. © 2022 The Authors.

As a result, EVs are rapidly increasing in popularity, electrifying the transportation sector. This poses a serious problem for the grid as existing distribution grids were mainly sized in the pre-EV era. In this paper, a method is proposed to determine the charging demand of future EV fleets in an office area and determine its flexibility potential. Office charging is studied as it differs from residential charging and a limited number of studies focused solely on office charging. The study is an empirical study and is based on analysing real transaction data of 42 EVs charging for over a year at Utrecht Science Park, Utrecht, the Netherlands, the considered case study. The transaction data allows for an examination of the impacts of future EV charging demand in an office area. The results based on a future scenario study show that in 2050, 4 out of 7 studied transformers are overloaded. This is followed by an analysis on the mitigation of the determined impact. This analysis also determined the flexibility in EV demand, around 50% of the EV demand can be delayed for more than 8 h. When this flexibility is used, overloading of 3 out of 4 transformers could be mitigated. This paper shows that placement of charging stations should be strategically performed, considering the capacity of the network and taking into account the forecasted load due to EVs charging. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Electric transformers; Electric vehicles; Energy security; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Distribution grid; Distribution transformer; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Empirical studies; Local air pollutions; Real transaction data; Residential charging; Transportation sector; Charging (batteries),Charging power; Demand flexibility; Electric vehicles; Grid impact,"M.A. van den Berg; Copernicus Institute of Sustainable Development, Utrecht University, Utrecht, Princetonlaan 8a, 3584 CB, Netherlands; email: marianvandenberg@outlook.com",,Elsevier Ltd,23524677,,,,English,Sustain.

In this context, it becomes crucial to implement a flexible, functional and fast responsive management of the voltage level and Reactive Power (RP) in the DN. The latest improvements in the Solid State Switches (SSS) field demonstrate they can be used as a Power Electronic (PE) converter. In particular, they have been shown to be capable of operating synchronously with transformers, making the Hybrid Distribution Transformer (HT) concept a potential and cost-effective solution to various DN control issues. In this paper, a HT-based approach consisting of augmenting the conventional Low Voltage (LV) transformer with a fractionally rated PE converter for regulating and controlling the RP in the last mile of the DN is proposed. In this way, it is expected to meet the demand of the future DN from an efficiency, controllability and volume perspective. The proposed approach is implemented using a back-to-back converter. In addition, a power transfer control topology is used to implement the proposed control of the RP injection that controls the voltage level at the Direct Current (DC) link. The proposed approach has been demonstrated in different load scenarios using the Piecewise Linear Electrical Circuit Simulation (PLECS) tool. The simulation results show that the proposed approach can compensate the loads with their need from RP instead of feeding them from the transmission grid at the primary side of the Distribution Transformer (DT). In this way, the proposed approach is able to decrease the transferred amount of RP in the transmission lines. © 2021 by the authors.

A model for wind speed and load demand estimation for each hour of the day is formulated by using the partition around medoids (PAM) technique over an annual database of load demand and wind speed. A multi-objective mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) approach for optimally locating and sizing the SST installations in the radial distribution network (RDN) is presented to address the dual objectives of voltage profile improvement (VPI) and energy loss reduction (ELR). Along with the SST parameters, the locations and number of wind turbine (WT) units to be integrated into the system are treated as optimization variables. Furthermore, the distribution power flow accounts for the distribution transformer’s (DT) operating losses as well as the approximate losses of the SST. The presented approach is tested on a 33-bus RDN and the results are reported for multiple case studies. The programming was developed in the MATLAB R2020a environment and the paretosearch algorithm (PSA) is used to address the MINLP problem. Other standard multi-objective optimization algorithms, including multi-objective multi-verse optimization (MOMVO), non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), and multi-objective salp swarm algorithm (MSSA) are used to compare the performance of the proposed method. The outcomes of the peak hour evaluation, with a 20% over-rating, show the active and reactive power demand on the MV side of the substation to have decreased by 56.3% and 30.1% respectively. The active line loss has been lowered by 76.95% and the reactive line loss has decreased by 76.14%. The absolute minimum voltage has increased by 7.314%.

In this regard, the role of unconventional sources of electricity, such as solar panels and wind farms, has increased. The growing role of direct current occurs due to the transition of the automotive industry from an internal combustion engine to an electric motor, as well as due to an increase in the service life and capacity of batteries. However, existing grids do not integrate well with receivers and sources using DC for the operation, which leads to a decrease in the quality, reliability of power supply and economic benefits. The way out of this situation is the transition from traditional to smart grids, which need to search for new methods, devices and solutions that meet the following rules: coordinated operation between DC and AC circuits with the ability to integrate batteries and charging stations; maintaining the quality of electricity in various operating modes, including off nominal ones; collection, conversion into digital form and transmission of information about the state and operating mode of the substation technological equipment and systems in real time operation; flexibility and reliability in the distribution and generation of electricity; high economic feasibility; self-diagnostic functions to ensure the detection of equipment and systems failure with an accuracy of a single module (block). At the same time, a classical transformer cannot cope with the assigned tasks; its disadvantages are given in this article. One of the solutions to this problem is the use of solid-state transformers-semiconductor AC power converters. The paper presents topologies and areas of application of classical AC and DC networks, their disadvantages. It is shown that with the development of direct current sources and consumers, problems arise with the integration of different types of current and voltage levels associated with the number of conversion steps and the quality of electricity. A block diagram of smart power supply networks based on a solid-state transformer is given with a description of what increases the overall efficiency of the network, the quality and flexibility in the distribution of electricity while reducing the number of conversion steps. The topologies of single-stage, two-stage and three-stage solid-state transformers are given and the areas of their application in different systems are shown. It has been established that for smart power supply networks, the most suitable is a three-stage topology of a solid-state transformer, which makes it possible to implement galvanic isolation with two DC-links, which will provide flexibility in switching power supply from DC to AC and vice versa, as well as increase the efficiency of the entire system as a whole.Mathematical modeling of the operation of a three-stage three-phase solid-state transformer for a symmetrical three-phase active-inductive load is presented. The system has output current and voltage feedback and automatic voltage regulation on the second DC-link. The tracking loop is implemented by changing the angle of block modulation in the controlled inverter and rectifier, which are part of the dual active bridge of a three-stage solid-state transformer. The controller is a proportional-integral controller. The graphs of the current and voltage changes when the load is switched on and off are given. It is shown that the voltage drop is insignificant and is almost completely compensated by the stored reactive energy in the reactive elements of a solid-state transformer.The applications of solid-state transformers, their advantages and disadvantages, as well as ways to eliminate these disadvantages are described in the article. The obtained results have shown the feasibility of using solid-state transformers in smart grids, in alternative energy, charging stations for autonomous devices of medium and high power, for energy distribution and in other areas. © 2021 IEEE.",Automotive industry; Charging (batteries); Digital devices; Efficiency; Electric power system economics; Real time systems; Smart power grids; Topology; Wind power; Charging station; Currents and voltages; Direct-current; Operating modes; Power supply; Power supply networks; Semiconductor technology; Smart power; Solid-state transformer; State-transformers; Electric power transmission networks,efficiency; power supply; semiconductor technology; smart grids; solid-state transformer,"B.A. Avdeev; Kerch State Maritime Technological University, Department of Ship's Electrical Equipment and Automation, Kerch, Russian Federation; email: dirigeant@mail.ru",,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-172819270-3,,,English,"Int.

The inrush current not only affects the performance of the transformer windings, but also affects the lifetime of the transformer. Many factors affect the inrush current, the most influential ones among which are the closing phase angle and the residual flux. In this paper, a dry-type transformer simulation model is built to analyze the influence of the inrush current on the performance of transformer windings during no-load reclosing conditions. Firstly, the inrush current was generated in the transformer windings during the no-load reclosing operation under different residual fluxes. Secondly, the field-circuit coupling 3d finite element method is used to analyze the electromagnetic force at different locations of the transformer windings under the influence of different inrush currents. The results of winding structural parameter variations are obtained through electromagnetic-structural coupling simulation, and the electromagnetic forces are used as the input parameter for the structural analysis. Finally, the residual flux is generated by controlling the opening and closing angle of the transformer through the phase-controlled switch, and the winding electromechanical characteristics are tested under different residual fluxes. Finally, comparisons of the test and simulation results are drawn to verify the impact of the closing angle and residual flux on inrush current and the winding deformation during the no-load reclosing conditions. © 2021 by the authors.

Most industries prefer oil-filled transformers instead of dry-type transformers. Transformer oil (Mineral oil) is universally used insulating material in the high voltage power transformer. According to a British Research Council report, overexploitation of petroleum products, the mineral oil will run out in near future. Because of its non-biodegradable property it does not an eco-friendly product also it does not meet current environmental acts. To the concern of limitation of resources and ecological system, nowadays researchers focus on substitute for conventional mineral oil mainly. So the researchers analyze the practicability, feasibility, sustainability and performance of Natural esters (vegetable oils), specifically in high voltage power transformers. Because, Natural esters possess outstanding biodegrading property, non-poisonous ness, greater fire safety guarantees and dielectric strength compared to the conventional transformer oil or mineral oil.

The results show that the setting of the proper thresholds plays the main role in the reliable and secure performance of NSPD and EPVA-based methods.

Plugin electric vehicles (PEVs) are becoming an alternative to vehicles powered by an internal combustion engine. This leads to environmental benefits, but these PEVs represent new challenges facing the power grid. Therefore, the power grid must be prepared for these challenges. This paper provides a comprehensive study of PEVs charging impact on the low voltage distribution grid. For this purpose, a typical Hungarian low voltage grid was modeled in DIgSILENT Power Factory. Two charging scenarios have been studied, uncoordinated charging and delayed charging. Three penetration levels of PEVs are considered in this paper as follows, 20%, 40%, and 60% Time sweep analysis is used to investigate transformer loading, feeders loading, voltage deviation and system total losses. The results show that at 60% penetration level with uncoordinated charging, both the distribution transformer and feeders thermal loading violation is experienced. On the contrast, with the delayed charging, all the grid components function at their normal rating at all penetration levels and no network upgrade is required. © 2018 IEEE.",Charging (batteries); Electric transformers; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Internal combustion engines; Plug-in electric vehicles; Vehicle-to-grid; Voltage distribution measurement; DigSILENT power factories; Distribution transformer; Environmental benefits; Low-voltage distributions; Plugin electric vehicle (PEVs); Time sweep; Transformer loadings; Transportation sector; Electric power transmission networks,delayed charging; low voltage distribution grid; Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs); time sweep analysis; uncoordinated charging,,Camurcu A.Y.; Cetin A.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-153864478-2,,,English,"Proc. - Int.

It contributes to intensify the flattening effects on the exchanging power pattern with a constraint of a fair profit reduction among households. The proposed method first uses a normal mixed-integer linear programming approach to find out the highest profit a household can get under a condition of a generous power limitation. It is highly possible that the resulted power aggregated from numerous homes may negatively affect power system operation such as violating voltage limits and overloading transformers. Based on that highest profit, the utility proposes the same percentage number of profit reduction for all households. Then, each HEMS performs an intensive mixed-integer quadratic programming optimization to flatten the selling and buying profiles whilst constraining the home profit reduction to the percentage set by the utility. A simulation shows that the peak power demand at the substation transformer would reduce about 44% if each household suffered a reduction of just 10% of the highest possible home profit. Since the flattening effects are improved if increasing the home profit reduction, our method is a basis for the utility to determine a compensation or alternative incentives to shave the peak-load and flatten the demand curve. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Automation; Energy management; Integer programming; Profitability; Quadratic programming; Transformer substations; Home energy management systems; Peak load; Rooftop solar; Smart homes; Smart household; Energy management systems,Home Energy Management System; Peak-load shaving; Rooftop solar; Smart home; Smart household,"H.

The proliferation of these PEVs will add stress to the already overloaded power grid creating new challenges for the distribution network. To mitigate this issue several researchers have proposed the idea of charging PEVs using renewables coupled with smart charging strategies. This chapter reviews the current literature on the state of the art infrastructure proposed for PEV charging facilities integrated with photovoltaic system. The proposed control algorithms, various smart charging techniques and different power electronic topologies for photovoltaic charging facilities (PCFs) are reviewed. Studies assessing the ability of photovoltaic charging stations to minimize the loading on distribution transformers are assessed. Finally, a simple and unique energy management algorithm for a PV based workplace charging facility based on dc link voltage sensing is presented. The power needed to charge the plug-in electric vehicles comes from grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) generation or the utility or both. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is validated through simulation and experimental results. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media Singapore.",,Distribution networ; Photovoltaic charging facility (PCF); Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs),,,Springer Verlag,16121287,,,,English,Power Systems,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84921661381

This fact has increased the volume of studies to evaluate the effectiveness of solutions based on infrastructure reinforcement. In this context, this work proposes an analytical method to update values of voltage magnitude in distribution systems when transformers and/or conductors are replaced. This analytical formulation can be implemented in spreadsheets for single-case analyses or it can be integrated in more-complex approaches, which demand multiple solutions, such as in optimization-based or Monte Carlo-based approaches. For the more-complex approaches the main objective is to speed up the process, as it is not necessary to run several power flows. In this work, the analytical formulation is integrated into a Monte Carlo-based process with two objectives: (a) to supply a wide-scale assessment of reinforcements to increase the electric vehicles hosting capacity in low voltage distribution systems analysing 25,000 real LV systems of a local utility; (b) to supply a systematic and wide validation of the analytical formulation.

This study offers an economic analysis of the role of EES in the low-voltage (LV) network as shared asset between rooftop photovoltaic (PV) system owners, distribution network and energy trading companies. A conceptual analysis of relevant drivers, such as increasing distributed energy resources (DER; primarily rooftop PV), decreasing EES cost, and expected benefits are assessed in a case study using annual sample data from a distribution network in eastern New South Wales, Australia. The study finds that shared EES located in the LV network, if joint revenue from PV customers, distribution network and energy trading companies is captured, can become NPV positive in 2023 and bring additional benefits to a range of stakeholders. A 500 kWh battery located next to a transformer and mitigating up to 30% overload is found to be optimal.

Community Energy Storage (CES) is one of the solutions to offer flexibility. In this paper two scenarios of CES ownership are proposed. Firstly, an Energy Arbitrage (EA) scenario is studied where an aggregator aims to minimize costs and CO2-emissions of an energy portfolio. Secondly, an Energy Arbitrage - Peak Shaving (EA-PS) scenario is assessed, which is based on a shared ownership between a Distribution System Operator (DSO) and an aggregator. A multi-objective Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) optimization model is developed to minimize the operation costs and CO2-emissions of a community situated in Cernier (Switzerland), using different battery technologies in the CES system. The results demonstrate a profitable system design for all Lithium-ion-Batteries (LiBs) and the Vanadium Redox Flow Battery (VRFB), for both the EA and EA-PS scenarios. The economic and environmental performance of the EA-PS scenario is slightly worse compared to the EA scenario, due to power boundaries on grid absorption and injection to achieve peak shaving. Overall, the differences between the EA and EA-PS scenarios, in economic and environmental performance, are small. Therefore, the EA-PS is recommended to prevent problematic loads on the distribution transformer. In addition, the Pareto frontiers demonstrate that LiBs perform best on both economic and environmental performance, with the best economic and environmental performance for the Lithium-Nickel-Manganese-Cobalt (NMC-C) battery. © 2019 The Author(s)",Switzerland; Carbon dioxide; Digital instruments; Electric power system economics; Electric transformers; Energy storage; Environmental management; Financial markets; Flow batteries; Integer programming; Lithium-ion batteries; Renewable energy resources; Battery technology; Community energy; Community energy storages (CES); Economic and environmental performance; Energy arbitrages; Mixed-integer linear programming; Peak shaving; Vanadium redox flow batteries; alternative energy; carbon emission; economic conditions; energy resource; energy storage; equipment; optimization; technological change; Multiobjective optimization,Battery technologies; Community energy storage; Energy arbitrage; Multi-objective optimization; Peak shaving,"T.

One of the main greenhouse gas emissions is CO2 gas and about 15% of greenhouse gas emissions, which is CO2, are produced through light vehicles such as pickups and cars. On the other hand, due to increased utilization of electric vehicles, the power grid structure needs to be developed and improved. Because of the vehicles effect on the low voltage network, distribution service operators (DSOs) will prepare the failed for the mentioned effects. In this paper, the impact of charging electric vehicles on low voltage networks structure and technology of electric vehicles have been investigated. A novel upper and lower based voltage controller is introduced as distributed agent-based model to control the voltage stability in test smart grid. In the proposed method, based on rule defining for distributed agent, the electric vehicle (EV) charging will cooperate with smart grid and its charging time will be moved from peak time to other times. By this action of agents, the smart grid load and the stability of voltage can be managed beside the economic benefits consideration. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method and the effect of electric vehicles, this method has been implemented on a low voltage network of a restricted district of Budapest based on DIGSILENT. According to obtained results, it could be considered that the maximum transformer loading with EV is about 41% and 36.6% without EV. Furthermore, transformer loading is about 14.761% for common arrival simulations to 10.072% without EVs. So, the proposed model can be effective in low voltage grids of transmission by preventing the pollution. The aforementioned district is characterized by predominantly low to medium density residential dwellings, where private off-street parking is available to facilitate the charging of electric cars from a conventional single-phase household power outlet. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Autonomous agents; Carbon dioxide; Charging time; Computational methods; Electric automobiles; Electric vehicles; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Transformer substations; Vehicle-to-grid; Distributed agents; Distribution services; Economic benefits; Low voltage network; Low-voltage grid; Residential dwelling; Transformer loadings; Voltage controllers; Electric power transmission networks,Carbon dioxide; Distribution service operators; Electric vehicles; Low voltage grid,"Y.

In light of the deficiency of actual effort, the power transformers on the power board and the distribution transformers used as amount of the open and private area are not adequately considered. Due to leakage in the oil tanks or associated channels, the protective oil in the transformer rarely comes into interaction with air, causing an oxidation reaction in the transformer oil, which is stimulated by temperature and irritation. From the development point of view, the transformer oil is presented as iron, copper and individual metal alloys. The situation discussed above will change the nature of the oil supplied by the transformer, which really affects the transformer performance, as it prevents the transformer from overheating the oil and oxidizing cellulose and exposes the transformer if it is not properly monitored.

Then we deduced the relationship between thermoelectric potential and the winding material, and built the test platform which could improve the temperature of transformer winding and identify winding material by measuring the thermoelectric potential. The experimental results show that the potential value of aluminum transformer is obviously higher than that of copper one, and it has a certain margin relative to the threshold value.

Their insulation system is comprised of dielectric oil and cellulose paper. The aging of the insulating system is influenced by several factors including high loading profile, temperature rise, and short circuits. Many diagnostic tests can be performed, and correctional measures may be taken to guarantee that consumers receive uninterrupted power supply. The remaining life of the transformer's cellulose paper insulation determines when the transformer's useful life ends. The mechanical or tensile strength of the solid insulation determines the aging of the paper insulation, which is calculated in terms of its Degree of Polymerization (DP). The direct method, which involves actual paper samples and is thus expensive and invasive, is the conventional method for calculating DP. Recently, a nonintrusive indirect approaches has been used to estimate the DP value from the furan compounds dissolved in the dielectric oil. In this work, the impact of the DP on the remnant life of four different transformer cellulose insulating materials is studied. An analysis of various cellulose insulation DP models are employed in estimating the DP and consequently the remnant life. The study further propose new formulae correlating 2-furaldehyde (2FAL) and DP in relation to the ageing process using regression analysis on a fleet of collected transformer oil samples.

Since it is not always possible to conduct experiments on large power transformers, it is desirable to design a simulation model that takes into account as many influencing factors on measurements as possible. Two major types of UHF sensors are used for PD measurements in power transformers, namely, drain valve sensors and window-type sensors. The former is directly introduced in the oil space of the transformer tank whereas the latter is installed in a dielectric window. Therefore, to reach the sensor head in a window-type sensor, the UHF signal has to travel through more dielectric media than in the case of drain valve sensors. The influence of the propagation path on the performance of the window-type sensors is studied in this contribution. Three-dimensional models of the dielectric window and the UHF sensors are created in CST Microwave Studio, and the antenna parameters are studied. Thereafter, the models are incorporated in a validated simulation model of a 420 kV power transformer, and the performance of the various sensor types are compared to determine if there is a significant influence of the propagation path on the sensitivity of the sensors. © VDE VERLAG GMBH ∙ Berlin ∙ Offenbach",Antennas; Oil filled transformers; Partial discharges; Power transformers; Antenna parameters; CST microwave studio; Dielectric windows; Large power transformers; Partial discharge measurements; Propagation paths; Three-dimensional model; Ultra-high frequency; Microwave sensors,,,,VDE Verlag GmbH,,978-380075355-0,,,English,VDE High Volt.

Thus, this paper proposes a heuristic method which suggests most suitable charging/discharging instances for an EV battery in a time-of-day regime. The key feature of this method is its simplified structure that requires basic input parameters, such as real-Time price signal, household demand, and EV's parameters. In addition, a heuristic method can quickly find the solution such that it can be implemented in simple computing devices. The scheme has been implemented on hardware and has proven its effectiveness. Results show that the algorithm works in two folds in reducing cost and energy dependence on the grid. © 2015 IEEE.",Automotive industry; Charging (batteries); Electric automobiles; Electric vehicles; Energy management; Energy management systems; Heuristic methods; Scattering parameters; Scheduling; Solar cells; Vehicle-to-grid; Charging station; Charging/discharging; Computing devices; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Optimal scheduling; Residential areas; Time of day; Uncontrolled charging; Secondary batteries,Charging points (CPs); electric vehicles (EVs); energy management system (EMS); time of day; vehicle to grid (V2G),"R.

This article proposes a new adaptive control strategy that manages PEV charging/discharging for peak shaving and load leveling in a distribution grid. For accurate and high fidelity transportation mobility modeling, real vehicle driving test data are collected from the field. Considering the estimated total required PEV battery charging energy, the vehicle-to-grid capabilities of PEVs, and the forecasted non-PEV base load, a reference operating point for the grid is estimated. This reference operating point is updated once at the end of peak hours to guarantee a full final state-of-charge to each PEV. Proposed method provides cost-efficient operation for the utility grid, utmost user convenience free from range anxiety, and ease of implementation at the charging station nodes. It is tested on a real residential transformer, which serves approximately one thousand customers, under various PEV penetration levels and charging scenarios. Performance is assessed in terms of mean-square-error and peak shaving index. Results are compared with those of various reference operating point choices and shown to be superior. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Battery management systems; Electric power transmission networks; Mean square error; Plug-in electric vehicles; Stochastic systems; Vehicle-to-grid; Grid integration; Peak shaving; Plugin electric vehicle (PEVs); Smart charging; Vehicle to Grid (V2G); Charging (batteries),grid integration; peak shaving; plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs); smart charging; vehicle-to-grid (V2G),"N.

Three types of actors are included in the system: distribution system operators (DSOs), fleet operators (FOs), and EV owners. In contrast to a typical hierarchical control system where the upper level controller directly controls the lower level subordinated nodes, this study aims to integrate two common indirect control methods: market-based control and price-based control into the hierarchical EVs' management system. Specifically, on the lower level of the hierarchy, the FOs coordinate the charging behaviors of their EV users using a price-based control method. A parametric utility model is used on the lower level to characterize price elasticity of EVs and thus used by the FO to coordinate the individual EV charging. On the upper level of the hierarchy, the DSO uses the market-based control strategy to coordinate the limited power capacity of power transformer with FOs. To facilitate the application of the two indirect control methods into the system, a model describing decision tasks in control is used to specify the essential functions that are needed in the control system. The simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions. © 2015 IEEE.",Commerce; Control systems; Costs; Elasticity; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Power transformers; Traffic congestion; Vehicle-to-grid; Congestion prevention; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Hierarchical control; Indirect control; Price elasticity; Electric machine control,Congestion prevention; Electric vehicles (EVs); Hierarchical control; Indirect control; Price elasticity model,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,23327782,,,,English,IEEE Trans.

This approach, however, is not valid anymore due to the presence of distributed generation, which is mainly based on renewable energies, and the increased number of plug-in electric vehicles that are connected at this voltage level for domestic use. In this paper the ongoing transition that distribution networks face is addressed. Whereas distributed renewable energy sources increase nodal voltages, electric vehicles result in demand surges higher than the load predictions considered when planning these networks, leading to congestion in distribution lines and transformers. Additionally, centralized control techniques are analyzed to reduce the impact of distributed generation and electric vehicles and increase their effective integration. A classification of the different methodologies applied to the problems of voltage control and congestion management is presented. © 2021 by the authors.
